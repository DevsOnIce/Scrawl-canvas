CHANGE LOG
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
131124
	- got node.js, grunt and uglify working on local development setup
	- upgrade to version 1.02
		- min file successfully created and tested against all demos and website
		- documentation updated
		- tutorial updated
		- website updated
		- latest version posted to SourceForge and GitHub
		
131123
	- fixed bug introduced with the changes made for fixing the dynamically loaded pattern bug
	- keyboard controls
		- using Mousetrap.js to capture keyboard input in demo104
		- updated demo104 to demonstrate moving around the isometric grid using the arrow keys
		
131122
	- zooming cells
		- new Cell.sourceMaxWidth, .sourceMaxHeight, .sourceMinWidth, .sourceMinHeight attributes
		- new Cell.zoom() function
			- only works if zoomed cell's source frame remains within its actual dimensions
	- demo104 (zooming the isometric grid) completed
	
131121
	- demo103 (isometric tiling) completed
	
131120
	- began investigating methods of implementing an isometric game (like Sim City) using Scrawl
	
131119
	- bugfix - loading images for use with Patterns
		- pattern not displaying when used with single sprite on canvas
	- added new functions: Design.delete(); Pattern.delete(); Color.delete()
		- designs are not deleted when sprite is deleted because other sprites might be using them
		- solves problem of deleting unwanted designs
	- amended Sprite.setDelta()
		- now handles .lineWidth and globalAlpha attributes
	- blog demo - ripples across images (not posted live)
		- more work on filters - displacement maps
			- couldn't get them to work
		- coded demo to use Wheel sprites for displacement
			- not what I wanted, but does work (once new functionality added to Scrawl.js)
		- demo not posted to live blog
			
131118
	- blog demo - importing local images into a scrawl canvas
	
131117
	- blog demo - dragging sprites between two separate canvases
	
131115
	- more work on filters
	- blog demo - gaussian blur on animated Picture sprite
	
131114
	- blog demo - dynamic path creation
	
131111
	- initial work investigating filters
		- Scrawl does not support filters
		- use CSS/SVG filters on the scrawl canvas to achieve a similar effect
	- blog demo - filter on text
		- appears as it should on FireFox, though very slow
		- some filter effects appear in Chrome/Opera
		- not working at all in Explorer
		
131107
	- blog demo - testing animated gradients
	- blog demo - Shape paths, text (the 'hello world' demo)
	
131106
	- added asynchronous loading of images for Picture sprite
		- constructor's object will look for .url attribute
			- url needs to be supplied as a string, and needs to point to web address of image
			- url attribute not retained by sprite object!
		- if .url exists, will call Picture.importImage() function
			- function calls scrawl.newPicture() once image has been uploaded and stored in library
	- move to v1.01
	- blog demo - import SVG image and spin it
	- updated tutorial
	- updated website
	- updated documentation
	- uploaded to SourceForge/GitHub
	
131105
	- experiments in getting scrawl canvases to run on a WordPress post
		- needed to adapt the Wordpress theme
			- amendments to head.php, footer.php
			
131104
	- styling the new WordPress blog
	
131103
	- added a WordPress blog to the scrawl website
	- adapted index page to link to blog
		- removed 'tour' button - the index page IS the tour
		- removed the 'about' button and made the about text permanently visible
		- removed button handling routines from index.js - no longer required
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
131030
	- website index page redesigned and recoded

131023
	- documentation update completed
	- started the process of updating the demos.js file
	
131022
	- rewrote Outline constructor and functions to remove eval
		- eval too risky - no reasonable way to prevent 3rd parties from tampering with outline.compiledData attribute
		- seems to work ok
	- updating documentation
	
131001-21
	- massive overhaul of the entire library
		- sprite positioning regularised
		- sprite collision detection regularised
			- consistency across sprites whatever their flip or roll attributes may be
			- Picture sprite color detection now takes into account sprite's flip and roll attributes
			- Shape sprites no longer use NESW collision point system
				- now expect .collisionPoints to be a number
				- number represents the no of collision points along Shape path
					- will allow lines/curves to have collision points strung along them
			- checkField/checkFieldAt functions rewritten
			- removed Sprite.addCollisionPoints(), .removeCollisionPoints() functions
		- experimental SVG import support removed
		- added in native import/export functions
			- reliant on creating/parsing JSON strings of sprite, design and group objects
			- .prepareForExport() functions for Group, Sprite, Point, Link and Design (Gradient/RadialGradient/Pattern/Color) objects
				- only attributes not equal to default values are included in the JSON string
			- new scrawl.importNative(string) function
			- new Group.exportNative(), Sprite.exportNative() functions
			- removed scrawl.save() function
		- testing and recoding of every demo to fit the new paradigms
			- demos 013,014,038,066,068,078,098,099,100,101 redundant
		- reintegrated scrawl.js and scrawl+sprite.js
			- maintaining two separate files was introducing too many stupid bugs
			- rewrote canvas and stack discovery/import/create functions
		- cell setEngine rewritten to fix bugs relating to .setToSprite
		- Groups reconceived
			- regularising towards the sprite 'default'
				- new .roll, .fieldTest, .fieldChannel attributes
			- offset calculation significantly rewritten
		- Sprite constructor .target flag separated from .group attribute
			- target now recodes objects so that they use their group as a pivot and their handle values act as offsets to the group origin point
			- new Sprite.targetGroup() function to respond to .target flag
		- Group.setHandles(), .getSpriteRange() functions dumped
			- replaced by .setGroupDimensions(), .setSpritesToGroupHandle() functions
				- Groups now have handles that work in the same manner as Sprite handles
		- Groups can now be rotated as a single unit
		- Sprite stamping functions overhauled
		- All references to .degree attributes removed from code
			- Scrawl.js is now 100% degree-based - will not accept radian values
		- Color object rewritten to remove many bugs
	- tested demos in Firefox, IE10, Safari(windows), Chrome, Opera
		- got 3D cat animation working again in Firefox
		- Opera now supports CSS3 3D transforms!!!

			- some animations involving collisions or path animations look slow in Firefox
			- IE10 still has CSS3 3D issues
	- MOVING TO VERSION 1.00
		- V1.00 IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS
	- updated changelog (this file) - long overdue!
	- TODO:
		- update documentation thoroughly

130930
	- project collisionOverhaul continues ...
		- Shapes no longer use the common collision points
			- instead all shapes take a number for collision points
			- points are distributed evenly around the path
	- current issues
		- overrides

130926-27
	- project collisionOverhaul continues ...

130925
	- fixed bug in Phrase.stamp-ing
	- project collisionOverhaul commences ...
		- collisions with cell fields
		- collisions within groups
			- currently oversensitive
			
130924
	- more work on regularising Outline sprites
	- fixing text along paths
		- done!
		- completely different solution to the old one
			- though can't get it to work properly with Arabic ...
	
130923
	- finally figured out what was going wrong with wheel positioning - fixed
	- changed context .fill attribute to '.winding'
		- to avoid all possible confusion with sprite.fill() functions
		- need to work out how to check hits in a Shape/Outline sprite with .winding === 'evenodd'
	- Shape sprite positioning: final decisions:
		- all lines (via makeLine(), makeQuadratic() and makeBezier() factories) APPEAR to be centered on their startXY coords
			- handleXY are set to 'left' and 'top' respectively
			- new .getPivotOffset() override effectively shifts lines back and up by half their widths/heights to make illusion work
			- new Shape.line attribute: true for line/quadratic/bezier
				- should be set to true for hand-coded lines to get correct positioning
		- all other Shapes are centered
		- tested ... works
	- fixing more demos
		- most working up to demo 090 ...
	
130922
	- Shape sprite positioning on flip, scale, roll, etc ... done
		- finally got it working in a (reasonably) sensible manner
	- removing collision detection options
		- killed Shape.checkHitUsingRadius, .checkHitUsingBox
		- killed Outline.checkHitUsingBox
			- both sprites now rely entirely on .isPointInPath()
	- Shape sprite positioning on flip, scale, roll, etc ... done
	- more work on cloning
	- much chasing down of bugs as testing changes on demos
		- most demos were fixed by alteration of Phrase .textAlign to .handleX
		- issue with centering circles 
			- not happy with failure to exactly place circle centre at startXY coordinates as default
		- some later demos were using .getCorners (which has now been dumped)
		- big issue with placing imported Outline sprites
		- need to do more on markers
		- between-sprite collision detection is the next big job
			- collisions against cell fields seems to work fine
		- also want to get text along path working again
			- works for single lines
			- need to re-implement word and glyph TAP
			
130921
	- rewrote sprite.pickupSprite(), sprite.dropSprite() functions
		- because there was a much simpler solution
		- meant abandoning much of yesterday's work
			- but worth it
	- introduced temporary attributes to sprites
		- .currentX, currentY, currentWidth, .currentHeight, .currentRadius
			- going to be used for drawing sprites
				- cuts down on the number of calls to getStartXY
		- .mouseX, .mouseY, .realPivot
			- used during mouse attachment for drag-and-drop
				- created when sprite first associates with mouse (drag)
				- destroyed when association breaks (drop)
	- collision detection
		- moving away from .getCorners
		- new collision detection system (for Blocks, Phrases, etc) uses ctx.rect() and .isPointInPath() JS functions
			- tied to rotate and flip functions, allows for point detection in rolled sprites!
			- extensive rewrites of related functions
	- new Phrase attributes: .backgroundColor and .backgroundMargin
		- for adding a background color to Phrase sprites
			- like postIt notes ...
			
130920
	- operation getCorners() & checkHit() (continued ...)
		- Shape sprites
			- all factory functions now produce relative paths, not absolute ones
			- clone function corrected for minor errors
			- all seems to be (finally) working
				- still some issues with lines and curves
					- hit boxes seem to be displaced a little
					- when start and end coordinates are horizontal/vertical to each other, boxes have no width/height
					- safest to use .checkHitUsingRadius to detect mouse
		- Outline sprites
			- changed factory functions to adapt the paths they create to be used by newOutline
			- adapted the checkHit() function to take into account .roll
		- changed Sprite.dropSprite()
			- now takes an object rather than a string
				{pivot:PIVOTNAME, restoreHandles:BOOLEAN}
				- restoreHandles defaults to 'true'
				- mainly for Shape objects
					- when true, will restore Shape handles, but may cause some jumping when pickup/drop occurs
					- when false, will not jump, but Shapes will now rotate around the new point
	- operation getCorners() & checkHit() COMPLETED (for now ...)
	- TODO
		- restore Phrase ability to track along paths
		- group flip
		- group roll
		- group clone
		- really ought to rationalise the inGroup and betweenGroup collision detection
			- still need to figure out how to detect collisions on rotated Block, Picture, Phrase (and Shape?) sprites
			- maybe also Wheels, though they always rotate around their centers?
			- think I've accomplished this for Outlines 
				- need to check to make sure they do what I think they do ...
		- SVG load 'style' attributes
			- will be using them for the exporting of stuff, so will need to import them too
		- develop .export() functions for sprites and groups, and associated stuff
			- to make pretty SVG files that can be used with the SVGload functions
		- check through all the SVG stuff
			- see if there's anything else Scrawl should be capturing
			- see if there's anything superfluous in the coding eg unused attributes
		- check through all Demos, recoding where necessary
		- transfer all the new stuff over to scrawl+stack.js
			- though maybe abandon having separate files for both?
				- maintaining 2 files is a lot of work
				- doable if can find a way to better minimise files?
					- really need to look at setting up Uglify.js and node.js on local network
		- update documentation
		- update tutorial
		- upgrade library and release it into the wild

130919
	- operation getCorners() & checkHit() (continued ...)
		- Picture sprites - done
		- Outline sprites - done
			- most Shape factory functions adapted to tale .outline attribute
				- when set to true, will generate an Outline sprite
				- otherwise, Shape sprite generated
				- currently not .makeRegularShape()
		- Shape sprites
			- some really weird stuff going on here ...
			- completely recoded the Shape clone function
			- working on integrating RegularShape factory to use the makePath factory
			- tons of tweaks to try and get (regular) shapes to behave similarly to other sprites re handles and collision zones
			- significant issue when cloning a previously cloned Shape sprite
				- pivot position is shifted way outside the sprite, sending it flying when rolled
			- big issues about displaying Shapes when flipped

130918
	- operation getCorners() & checkHit()
		- code tweaked to accommodate scaling
			- works for Blocks
			- Phrases playing up ...
	- MAJOR CHANGE
		- complete rewrite of Phrase sprite object
			- was becoming too unwieldy and fiddly
			- made a decision to break it into two objects
				- Phrase object is like a shell group masquerating as a sprite
				- NEW Text object
					- inherits from Scrawl, not Sprite
					- holds details of single lines of text
					- Phrase objects include array of Text objects holding phrase text
					- Phrases stamp by looping through their .texts array
					- Text objects do the actual stamping
		- new system clones perfectly
			- old multiline Phrases were not clonable (an undiscovered bug)
		- Phrase.getCorners() function recoded
			- collision box now fits neatly around multiline text however it is positioned, flipped or scaled
			- while Phrase animates rotations fantastic, the collision box doesn't (yet) rotate with the sprite
				- also true of Blocks and Pictures
				- will need to revisit this 'known' bug at a future date
		- Phrase layout now makes sense
			- handleXY controls the positioning of the Phrase sprite as a whole
			- .textAlign manages the text justification within the Phrase
			- .textBaseline manages the vertical positioning on the first line of text only
				- collision box compensates for .textBaseline manipulation
				- what was once a mystery now becomes a little clearer
		- text flipping 
			- .flipUpend now upends the entire Phrase, not line-by-line (as previously happened)
		- NEED to recode the whole text along paths stuff ...
	- operation getCorners() & checkHit() (continued ...)
		- Wheel sprites
			- recoded .getCorners()
				- Wheel wasn't positioning as expected when handles changed
					- because they were drawn from their center, not top left edge
				- changes don't affect much stuff
					- added code to set default handleXY to center on initialisation
					- but when handles are used, the Wheel now acts as expected
			- recoded .buildPath()
				- was completely ignoring flip booleans
					- difficult to spot, but important - now fixed
			- recoded .checkHit()
				- correctly picks up wheel, whatever the settings of its handles, scale or flip
				
130917
	- importing SVG <image> coded up
		- takes no account of any elements inside the element tags
		- also doesn't care about preserving aaspect ratios
			- may change this later after additional thought
	- the <use> element ...
		- Scrawl is going to ignore this element
			- SVG uses it to place and display already defined elements
			- Scrawl captures elements defined in the <defs> tag and places them in a group
			- Scrawl has no interest in accurately recreating an SVG scene on the HTML5 canvas element
				- it's purely about saving and loading Scrawl sprites using the SVG format
	- cloning outlines
		- coded up Outline.clone() function - overrides Sprite.clone()
		- tested in Demo100
	- uncovered and fixed bug in Sprite.pickupSprite()
		- was failing when handleXY attributes set to anything except numbers
		- Outline sprites required their own versions of .pickupSprite() and .dropSprite() - coded
	- fixed Shape cloning bug (in Demo050)
		- clones of clones were being displaced by handle offsets
		- fixed by using the Outline solution for pickupSprite() and dropSprite()
	- major undertaking to rationalise all sprite getCorners() and checkHit() functions
		- major problems with all sprites when cloning/dragging flipped sprites
		- first big task - align all possible collision areas with displayed sprites, whatever their flip state
			- Block - done
			- Phrase - done
				- major work, as Phrases affected both by handles and by textAlign/textBaseline
			- will need to revisit these before proceeding to make sure scaling is also covered.
				
130916
	- fixing all the issues thrown up by the demos checking
		- Shape factories fixed so that Points generated have the suffixes _p1, _p2, _p3, _p4
			lines - 1: start; 2: end
			quadratics - 1: start; 2: control; 3: end
			beziers - 1: start; 2: startControl; 3: endControl; 4: end
		- complete rewrite of the Shape.clone() function
			- working as it should
				- potential issues about handles when cloning a Shape and immediately giving it handles
					- as happens in Demo050 (clone + pivot:mouse)
		- further work with Designs
			- animated gradients and colors will now automatically update
				- new Design.autoUpdate attribute to trigger this behaviour
				- rewrite of Context.getChanges function
			- fixed the Pattern clone/update issues
				- Demo040 returned to normality
	- a number of demos have been rewritten to take into account changes/fixes
		- won't be able to do this if people start using Scrawl for their project
			- got to remember backwards compatibility!
			- but some of the demos were written way back and kludged to fit as the library evolved
	- executive decision re Outline markers
		- not going to have them
			- purpose of SVG is to store/load Scrawl sprites, not to recreate SVG scenes on the HTML canvas element
			- Shape sprites now make use of markers; Outline sprites are intended to be a lot simpler than Shapes
	- STILL TO DO
		- (done) load SVG images into the image part of the library, ready for sprites to use them
		- (dealt with) 'use' links where SVG reuses template elements
		- (done) cloning outlines
			- also have done nothing about updating the data attribute of cloned Shape sprites
				- could be solved by recoding the Shape factories to use relative coordinates rather than absolute ones?
				- is it really necessary? will only be used for SVG output, which can carry manipulation data beyond the path data
		- Outline sprites need a thorough test regime of new demos
		- loading attributes enclosed in an SVG 'style' attribute
		- need a whole system of functions for exporting sprites and groups in SVG-style format
		- serious work on Groups needed
			- flipping
			- cloning
			- rolling
			- scaling
			- collisions as a single pseudo-sprite
		- documentation now badly out of date
		- tutorial will need a thorough going over
			- which means porting over all the demos to the demos.js file
		- need to port all changes over to the scrawl+stack.js file
		- need to investigate better ways of minimising file size
			- Uglify.js ... but requires node.js ... which means virtualisation stuff ...
			
130915
	- marker stuff (mostly) completed
		- tweaked scrawl.parseSVGElement()
			- all sprite forms (except text) now respect the outline command
				- though some will fail to produce outlines as no .data path coded for them yet
		- scrawl.makePath() now reacts ton the .setPivotXY attributes correctly
			- .setPivotXY attributes can now take strings, numbers or percentages
		- new SubScrawl.getPivotOffset() helper function
		- new Shape.stampMark() helper function
	- worries about color opacity
		- SVG allows fill and stroke opacities to be set separate from the color itself
		- might be worth creating color objects for each imported sprite and varying opacity that way?
			- not convinced we need another pair of attributes added to the factory functions ...
	- testing all demos against enhanced library
		- 036,059 (arrows) recoded to use .makePath() factory
		- 053 recoded to use makePath(), .fill, .scaleOutline
		- 044 (spinning wheel) recoded to use Color object
		- 057 (drawing lines) recoded to make use of outlines
		- broken: 
			- 080 point associations
			- 081 two bombs exploding on each other breaks game?
			- 092, 102, 040 - completely buggered
			- 060, 068, 084, 085 - cloning lines
			- (done) all the collision area demos need to be speeded up significantly!
			
130914
	-fixed map demo
		- poorly planned coding in the demo, rather than a scrawl.js issue
		- still need to look at why some Outlines are not firing when they should
			- fixed - traced bug to Outline.checkHit()
			- all working as should be now, and very quick!
	- removed String.strtr() shim from Scrawl.js
		- no more need for it, as now planning to use SVG-type files for import/export
	- progress with markers
		- need to sort out handles for Shape sprites
			- does not like percentages or labels
		- scaleX seems to be working, but not scaleY, when initially building marker sprite from SVG file
	- housekeeping ...
		- deleted all the .getObjectData() functions
			- no longer required
		- deleted all sprite .getEndX(), getEndY(), getWidth(), .getHeight() functions
			- covered by .getCorner() functions
			- amended all functions using the deleted functions
	- playing with markers
		- fixed most problems with markEnd
			- except need to use setStartTo instead of handleXY
				- introduce new attributes for make factories: setPivotX, setPivotY
					- use percentages ...
					- don't save in sprite object ...
		
130913
	- fixed Point bug
		- bug was in Point.getData()
			- a .setPolar() call was triggered whenever .distance and .angle were not true (ie: 0, null, false)
			- fixed the point constructor to set these attributes to false, if not supplied by the data object
			- then checked to see if attributes were boolean false before triggering thre call to .setPolar()
		- also fixed scrawl.make factories so only makePath (and makeRegularShape) triggered a sprite stamp to set the polar coordinates
		- fixed bug in Shape.clone()
			- wasn't stamping newly created clones to reset their points' attributes to the new data
			- tested on demo061 - works
	- import/export
		- finally reached a workable system for exporting Shape sprites as path strings
		- many bugs overcome
		- Shape path data can be imported as either Shape or Outline objects
			- shape sprites have start coordinates at the center (rectangle, ellipse, regularshape), or starting values
			- Outline sprites fix the start coordinates to the top left hand corner of the sprite
				- just like Blocks and Pictures
		- fixed bug in Outline stamping methods that was sending sprites everywhere when rotated
		- demos106 and 107 to test - currently working okay in Firefox - even when flipped
	- TODO
		- need to get back on track with markers
		- need to do loads of testing on Outline collisions
			- need to think about how to handle collisions for rotated Block, Picture and Outline shapes
				- outlines do have the advantage of being able to test for hits within the outline
					- but no idea how this is affected by rotations and flips
		- more SVG stuff: 
			- images
			- the attributes stuff is still flaky and tempramental
				- users will no doubt want to import badly coded SVGs ...
		- everything needs to be documented and included in the tutorial
			- changes will be enough to bump Scrawl up to v0.4
		- (DONE in part) demo103 world map
			- need to look at collision detection
				- for some reason some of the countries are not triggering - probably a box issue?
				- also, too slow to identify country under mouse cursor
		
130912
	- fixed bug in Sprite.flipCanvas()
		- was not handling sprite.handleXY properties properly, when set to string labels (top, left, center, etc)
	- SubScrawl.getStartX(), .getStartY()
		- extended the top/center/bottom/left/right values to all sprites
		- added percentages - n% is a percentage of the width for getStartX(); likewise a percentage of the height for getStartY()
	- new SubScrawl.getDimensions - to return the unscaled dimensions of the object
		- overridden by Cell and Wheel
		- used by SubScrawl.getStartXY functions
	- converted all 'make' factories (except makeRegularShape) to use scrawl.makePath();
	- got rid of scrawl.makePolyLine(), .makePolygon() factories
		- for SVG stuff, converted the polyline/polygon data to path strings by adding 'M' to the data string (and 'z' for polygons)
		- simplifies stuff
	- lots of experimenting and thinking about SVG markers
		- started converting sprite painting functions to acommodate marker sprites
		- ensured that when parsing SVG, shapes within <marker> elements are given visibility:false attributes
	- somehow managed to reintroduce the 'point not updating when moving startXY' bug ...
		
130911
	- NEW SPRITE
		- Outline
			- much like block, except uses SVG path data to draw itself
			- much fun to get the path parsing stuff right
			- handleXY can take top|centre|bottom|left|right
			- attribute .checkHitUsingBox - for quick hit checks
				- when false (default), creates the outline and checks for point in outline thingy
			- draws itself using canvas translate/rotate stuff
		- tested on the WorldMap, which now loads massively quicker than when turning the path data into Shape sprites
			- using Shapes was generating over 12000 individual point and link objects
		- also tested for all supported letters: M m Z z L l H h V v C c S s Q q T t
		- TODO
			- need to investigate hits-at-location stuff
				- because current system is a lot slower than the opposition!
	- scrawl.loadSVG()
		- now takes an object as its argument:
			.loadPathsAsOutlines 
				- when true, path elements will be turned into Outline sprites
				- default (false) is to create Shape sprites from <path> elements
			.classname
				- when supplied, function will scour DOM for elements with class=CLASSNAME
			.getInlineSVG
				- when true, scours DOM for inline SVG elements
				- default is false
			.cell
				- cell in which to load the created sprites
				- (not yet implemented fully)
	- STILL NEED TO CONSIDER ...
		- SVG text
			- including textarea
			- ignore all attempts to account for text selection/editing or alignment/styling of individual glyphs
		- SVG images (including video? supported by SVGTiny. But not audio)
		- SVG linking to other websites? - not convinced Scrawl needs to support that sort of thing
		- 'use' links where SVG reuses template elements
		- markers at the start, end and along paths
			- SVG Tiny doesn't appear to mention them, but they seem like fun
				- and should be quite easy to do? Already using paths for animation stuff
		- (DONE) Flipping Pictures associated with sprite sheets
			- something's badly wrong with defining what gets flipped
			- (probably) critical for game developers

	- finalised Color object
		- functions include:
			.get(), .set(), .setDelta(), .update(), .generateRandomColor, .convert(), .toDecimal(), .toHex() 
		- checked random color generation, updating colors using .update()
			- tested on amended demo050 (cloning)
				- works in Firefox
	- testing with very big 'SVG' - Raphael.js's worldMap
		- fixed bug in Sprite.get()
			- missed out fillStyle, .strokeStyle
		- takes almost 30 seconds to convert to Shapes!
		
130907-09
	- changes during the SVG investigation:
		- dumped the scrawl.load() and scrawl.save() functions
			- loading and saving via SVG will be a lot easier
		- new object: Color - part of the Design suite
			- SVG allows users to define colors in a variable for future use
			- Scrawl does it better ...
			- made Color objects clonable
		- based SVG support on SVGTiny, not the full SVG
			- principally cuz it avoids the horrors of the arc
		- scrawl.loadSVG()
			- takes the attributes:
				.getInlineSVG - boolean
					- true will load all svg files found in the DOM
				.classname
					- searches DOM for <object> or <embed> elements with classname
					- extracts and processes SVG from them
		- scrawl.getSVGByClass(classname)
		- scrawl.parseSVGElement()
			- helper function where all the hard work happens
			- currently parses the following tags:
				- svg, g, defs - each creates a group object
				- title, desc, 
				- solidcolor, lineargradient, radialgradient, stop
				- rect, circle, ellipse
				- line, polyline, polygon
				- path - all SVGTiny path drawing syntax
				- text 
					- very basic so far
					- don't want Scrawl to become a replica of SVG
						- so not planning to take it beyond basic support
		- additional helper functions for .parseSVGElement()
			- getVal()
				- converts measure strings (20px, 3em) into pixel values
			- buildSpriteParameters
				- a lot of work has gone into handling SVG inheritence
				- converts SVG parameters into parameters used by Scrawl sprites
		- scrawl.makePolyLine()
			- new line factory
			- takes a set of data suitable for use by the .makeCartesianPoints() factory
			- returns new open Shape sprite
		- scrawl.makePolygon()
			- another new line factory
			- uses .makePolyLine()
			- returns a new closed Shape sprite
		- scrawl.makePath()
			- converts SVG path data into a new Shape sprite
			- handles MmZzLlHhVvCcSsQqTt
			- does NOT handle Aa - which isn't part of the SVGTiny spec
		- the following functions completely rewritten to make use of .makePath() factory:
			- scrawl.makeEllipse(), .makeRectangle(), .makeBezier(), .makeQuadratic(), .makeLine()
				- rationalises factory onto a single system
				- not yet worked out how to update .makeRegularShape() to new system
		- extensive rewrite of Cell.setEngine()
			- to add in some functionality lifted from SVG
				- gradients can now be set to sprites as well as cells
					- new Design.setToSprite attribute
					- used with fillStyle and strokeStyle
				- NEW FILL RULE
					- scrawl can now handle 'evenodd' as well as the default 'nonzero'
					- browsers implement this in different ways
						- 'evenodd' currently works on Firefox and Chrome only
				- LINEDASHES
					- again, not implemented by all browsers
		- new Context object attributes:
			.fill 
				- for the fill rule
			.lineDash, .lineDashOffset
				- for handling line dashes
				- lineDash is an array of numbers setting out the dash pattern
				- lineDashOfset is the offset for starting the line
					- updated Sprite.setDelta() so lineDashOffset can be updated dynamically
						- Scrawl now has Marching Ant lines!
		- updated Context.getContextFromEngine()
			- not convinced it's necessary to initialize each Context object to current canvas contextvalues ...
		- updated Context.getChanges()
			- to handle another new feature
				- line and shadow scaling can be switched off by new sprite attribute flag
		- Groups ...
			- Groups can now be NESTED
			- new Group attributes to handle nesting:
				.isSprite
					- eventual aim is to allow a group to simulate a sprite
				.groups
					- an array of groupnames representing subgroups
			- new Group.sortGroups() - for sorting groups before calling them to stamp
			- Group.getOverride()
				- lifted out of the .stamp() method
				- now used by sprite.getCorner functions
					- which in turn are used by the new design-to-sprite thingy
			- updated Group.forceStamp(), .stamp() to take these changes into account
			- TODO
				- needs a lot more work to make groups simulate sprites
				- may need a complete rethink of the Group object's structure
		- new Sprite attributes:
			- Sprite.data
				- used in particular by Shape sprites for storing their SVG path instructions
					- not used beyond initializing the sprite
					- may come in useful as part of a new load/save system
			- Sprite.scaleOutline
				- when true (default), lines and shadows are scaled alongside the sprite
				- the SVG default is NOT to scale lines (I think)
		- updated Sprite.get() to handle new Context object attributes
		- Sprite.setDelta() now accepts changes to .lineDashOffset
			- for the Marching Ants innit
		- sprite .getCorners() functions calculate current effective position and dimensions for the sprite
			- used by the context engine to recalculate gradients set to a sprite
			- may also have broader uses for code rationalisation eg collision detection stuff
			- Phrase.getCorners() updated
			- new Block.getCorners(), Wheel.getCorners(), Picture.getCorners(), Shape.getCorners()
		- fixed annoying Shape.setStartTo() bug
			- which was causing rotated shapes to set their starts to anywhere except the place requested
		- fixed Link.sketch() bug
			- caused sketching to stop when the first close instruction was encountered
			- not good for SVG imports where many close instructions can be found in a single data string
		- Design.sortStops() function rewritten
			- to remove any possibility of a color stop being set to exactly 0 or 1
		- NEW Gradient/RadialGradient attributes
			.startRangeX, .startRangeY, .endRangeX, .endRangeX
			.startRangeRadius, .endRangeRadius
				- the new set gradient to sprite thingy measures distances in 'percentages' of the sprite width/height
					- thank you, SVGTiny, for that heartbreak
		- plans for the new Color object include
			- being able to randomly generate colors, given minmax values
			- animating colors by changing their rgba values
	- TODO:
		- more SVG conversion work
			- need to get head around whole viewbox thingy
			- SVG elements can have a 'style' attribute
				- doesn't seem to be part of SVGTiny, but probably worth supporting
			- images - how are they imported? used?
			- text - how much of their attributes stuff can be ported over?
			- markers on paths stuff
			- Executive Decisions: no animation stuff; no DOM interaction stuff
		- finish work relating to Groups pretending to be sprites
			- eg flip-as-group, roll-as-group, drag-drop-as-group, etc
		- (DONE) finish Color object
		- update some demos to further test/make use of this functionality
		
130906
	- investigating SVG import/export (again)
		- preparation work - created new scrawl+svg.js file for experiments
		- amended Group
			- new .groups array attribute
			- new .sortGroups function
			- amended Group.stamp() function
				- will check to see if there are any subgroups
				- if yes:
					- sorts them based on their .order attribute
					- checks to see that each subgroup is not the same as this group (to hopefully prevent immediate recursion hell)
					- calls .stamp on each subgroup
		- new scrawl.loadSVG() function
			- this is where all the conversion work will take place
			- scrawl.getSVGByClass() function - helps .loadSVG() locate SVG DOM fragments to work on
				- SVG files can be included in the webpage either by:
					- directly embedding the <svg> into the page
					- <object id="cow1" data="img/cow01.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="demo103x">
					- <embed id="cow2" src="img/cow01.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="demo103x">
					- not keen on the idea of dynamically loading the file
						- cuz experiments with images and patterns have always required an .onload thingy
							- leads to rendering issues if image not loaded quickly enough
			
130905
	- bugfixes - animating multiline phrases
		- rewrote Sprite.stamp(), Phrase.stamp()
			- Sprite has new helper methods: .setStampUsingPivot(), prepareItemForStamp()
			- for consolidating repeated code and making maintenance a lot easier
		- rewrote Phrase.multiline()
			- lines weren't picking up all of the head's attributes
			- also, positioning issues
		- edited Phrase.clone() override function
			- because Sprite.clone wasn't triggering the final cloned object to get its font ready eg for scaling
			- problems with double exposure
				- more general problem, fixed by setting all line visibilities to 'false' and forceStamping them in the stamp function
		- new Phrase .setDelta() override function
		- MAJOR BUG fixed 
			- scaled sprites were jumping during pickup
				- Sprite.pickupSprite() recoded to take scaling into account
	- added scrawl.stampBackground()
		- for completeness
	- had another go at improving Phrase boxing for collision detection
		- got it working in a reasonable manner
	- updated documentation
	- updated tutorial
	- upgrade to v0.304
	- updated website
	- uploaded to SourceForge
	- updated GitHub
		
130904
	- made Scrawl's Array/Number/String prototype additions a little bit safer
	- working on flips
		- added two new attributes to Sprite objects: .flipX, .flipY
		- added new Sprite.flipCanvas() helper function
		- amended Sprite.callMethod() to make the magic happen
		- updated demo062 (carousel on ellipse path) to test new features
		- added NEW DRAWING METHOD - sprite.clearWithBackground()
			- sprite will paint the canvas with canvas's backgroundColor before stamping itself onto it
				- done to give the mirror effect to the carousel
			- thus new methods for all types of sprite (Block, Phrase, Wheel, Picture, Shape)
			- amended Sprite.stamp(), Phrase.stamp()
		- corrected bug where cell would not draw its background color except via its compile() function
			- new Pad.getCellsForDisplayAction()
				- removes repeated code into its own function
			- amended Pad.clear(), Pad.compile()
			- added Pad.stampBackground()
			- new Cell.stampBackground() function
	- updated documentation
			
130903
	- added Phrase.fixedWord boolean attribute
		- for handling eg Arabic text on path
			- method used by Scrawl to calculate glyph widths doesn't work for Arabic fonts
				- because letters are position-sensitive - different glyphs for the same letter at beginning,middle, end of word
		- tested; works ok.
	- fixed scrawl.makeName()
		- had the potential for a buffer overflow if someone cloned and recloned over and over
		- also had to fix Sprite.clone(), Phrase.clone() to fit in with changes
		- had to update all the scrawl.makeXXX methods
		- tested in Firefox
	- Phrase multiline texts
		- Scrawl will now create and chain Phrase objects to handle multiline texts
			- works both with the factory method and with .clone()
			- new attributes and functions
				Sprite.callMethod()
				Phrase.head, .currentLine, .isHead, .lines, .lineHeight
				Phrase.multiline()
	- tested all demos in Firefox
		- fixed demo081 (space invaders)
			- aliens were not being covered by checkHitUsingImage
				- imageData was being reset to the bomb image each time a new bomb was created
				- solved by giving the alien template sprite a name!
	- updated documentation
	- updated tutorial
		- for text along path and multiline phrases, not load/save
	- tested new demos in other browsers
		- IE10
			- not keen on heavily decorated text - has issues clearing the canvas
				- rewrote demo to keep shadow stuff away from IE
		- Chrome
			- letters jiggle
			- multiline - repeated one line (of centered text)
		- Firefox - all good
		- Opera
			- mangles the Arabic text, but otherwise all seems fine
		- Safari (windows) - all seems fine
	- upgrade to v0.303
	- update website
	- upload to SourceForge
	- update GitHub
			
130902
	- bugfixes: path tracking
		- sprites no longer jump when passing from one sub-path to the next
		- sprite.path attribute can now be set during sprite creation (not after it) for all sprites
	- revisiting the Phrase object
		- text-to-path functionality added
			- major changes to Phrase object and functions
			- added Cell.restoreShadow(), Sprite.restoreShadow()
				- to handle bug where only initial letter of path phrases was getting a shadow (drawFill, fillDraw)
		- demo102 to test; also amended demo061
			- can't work out how to successfully bend Arabic fonts
				- added Phrase.fixedWidth, .fixedPhrase in an attempt to at least make Arabic phrases track paths legibly
		- tested in browsers
			- chrome 
				- has bad shaky letter syndrome
				- apparently a known bug in chrome that nobody's bothered to fix yet
			- all other browsers
				- works perfectly!
	- NEED TO:
		- tackle multi-line text
			- got some ideas on how to implement that easily
			- will be able to add the lineSpacing attribute
		- can also think of adding the letterSpacing attribute?
		- update documentation - Phrase section, paths section
		- upgrade to v0.303
			
130901
	- started GitHub account for Scrawl
	
130831
	- created two files
		- scrawl.js contains all the core functionality for drawing on canvases
		- scrawl+stack.js is the full API, including stacks
		- going to be issues about keeping both files in sync
			- but taking out the stack stuff makes scrawl.js a smaller file (thus more competitive?)
	- updated affected demos
	- moved to version 0.302
	- updated documentation
	- updated tutorial page
	- updated website
	- uploaded to Sourceforge
	
130830
	- complete overhaul of Pattern object
		- now loads images supplied as a .source attribute (rather than being pre-loaded) correctly
			- does lead to a timelag due to the use of an .onload() function
			- timelag is solved if sprites using the pattern are part of an animation loop
		- override the .clone() function to do a basic construction, not using any of the existing element's attributes
			- utter cheating, but cloning leads to big problems for Patterns
			- will eventually get rid of the .clone() altogether, once been through all demos to remove Pattern clones
		-rewrote demo040, for the testing of stuff
	- NEED to look at loading Picture images in similar manner
		- at the moment, all images need to be preloaded before they can be used with Picture sprites
		- not that it causes much of a problem for my demos, but people will be people ...
	- saving and loading of sprites
		- new scrawl functions - scrawl.load(), scrawl.save()
			- saving the sprites puts a JSON string in the scrawl.object part of the library
			- copy that string out to a DOM element and use scrawl.load(getElementById(elementID).innerHTML, function());
			- Scrawl will reconstruct sprites (including Picture and Pattern images) from string and carry on as normal!
		- new Scrawl.timestamp attribute
			- so every object gets a timestamp on creation
			- added because I have some vague ideas about comparing objects so changes can be sent over a network??
				- can always be removed later if nothing comes of the idea
		- new Sprite.getObjectData() function used with the scrawl.save()
			- overridden by Pattern, Scrawl, Shape, Picture - they have special needs
		- new Image.getImageData()
			- returns image data in toDataURL() format (always .png)
		- save/load only deals with sprites and stuff associated with sprites
			- eg Point, Link, both gradients, Pattern, Image, AnimSheet, Group
			- not touching Cells or above!
		- NEED to include a new section in the tutorial to cover all this stuff - but where? 
			- don't want it near the top - not that important ...
	- RENAME: Image object becomes ScrawlImage
		- obvious conflict with JavaScript's "new Image()" command
	- adapted some demos (096-101 - will be renumbered later) to test the new functionality
		- all but one (finally) works as expected in Firefox
		- 098 - colour at mouse cursor - data tables not triggering on initial load, page has to be refreshed
	- updated documentation
	- updated Patterns section of tutorial
	
130829
	- investigating the loading and saving of stuff ...
	
130828
	- fixed new Shape factories
		- render speeds vastly improved
	- fixed bug in Point constructor
		- was stopping demo045 from working
	- coded demo104 - remake of the carousel, using an ellipse and paths as the carousel frame
	- looking at tangents on path
		- current most annoying bugs: 
			- can't set .path attribute for Shape factories which use scrawl.makeCartesianPoints 
				- (.makeLine(), .makeQuadratic(), .makeBezier(), .makeEllipse(), .makeRectangle())
				- temporary fix: set .path attribute on sprite after it is created
			- animating things round an ellipse Shape leads to flickering where the ellipse curves join
				- temporary fix: add a tiny amount to the initial pathPosition eg 0.6000005 instead of 0.6
		- added:
			SubScrawl.pathRoll - path rotation value (degrees)
			SubScrawl.addPathRoll - boolean: true to add the path roll value; false by default
		- updates to:
			Sprite.getAngle(), Sprite.stamp(), Sprite.rotateCell(), Sprite.unrotateCell(), Point.recalculate()
		- done
			- all sprite types will now rotate along their paths
	- rough tests for scaling paths
		- seems to work in demos; not fully investigated
	- updated documentation
	- updated tutorial
	- moved to version 0.301
	- updated website
	- uploaded new version to SourceForge

130827
	- finalised initial work on path animation - the complete list of revisions is:
		- new Shape attributes and functions:
			.pointList - holds array of POINTNAMEs
			.linkList - holds array of LINKNAMEs for line, quadratic and bezier Link.species
			.linkDurations - array of Link lengths
			.perimeterLength - total length of Shape's visible Link objects
			.getPerimeterLength(bool)
				- if necessary (re)calculates, otherwise returns, .perimeterLength
				- if bool set to true, triggers recalculation
			.buildPositions()
				- helper function used to calculate .linkDurations values
			.getPerimeterPosition(number, var1, var2)
				- number between 0 and 1 - distance from first Link's start point to where measurement is to be taken
				- var1: boolean - false, uses midline calculations; true, uses distance travelled calculations
					- setting boolean to true will force sprite animated along path to show a constant speed
				- var2: boolean - true to calculate pathRoll value
				- returns {x:COORDINATE, y:COORDINATE, r:number} - r = pathRoll value
		- amended Link and Point constructors to add references to their Shape's .pointList and .linkList attributes
		- added new .set() functions to Link and Point, to add/delete references to Shape.pointList, .linkList
		- new Link attributes and functions:
			.sprite - SPRITENAME, specifically the Link's .startPoint Point's .sprite value
			.length - Link's current calculated length
				- if set to true in constructor, will calculate initial length
				- NOT to be used for setting a Link's length!
			.precision - number of segments used for calculating length; default: 100
			.positions - array of JavaScript objects describing end points for each generated segment
				- if set to true in constructor, will calculate initial segment lengths/coordinates
				- .positions[0] is the Link's .startPoint coordinates
				- object in the form of {
					x: segment end x coordinate, 
					y: segment end y coordinate, 
					length: segment length,
					cumulativeLength: length of all segments up-to-and-including this segment,
					}
			.pointOnLine(origin coordinate, destination coordinate, number between 0 and 1)
				- helper function
			.getPointCoordinates()
				- another helper function 
					- returns object {
						start: {x: value, y: value}, 
						end: {x: value, y: value},
						control1: {x: value, y: value},
						control2: {x: value, y: value}
						}
			.getPositionOnLink(number)
				- uses midline calculations
				- where number is between 0 and 1 - distance along Link's bezier lines to be used for generating coordinates
					- returns object {x: value, y: value}
			.getSteadyPositionOnLink(number)
				- uses distance travelled calculations
				- where number is between 0 and 1 - distance along Link to be used for generating coordinates
					- returns object {x: value, y: value}
			.getLength()
				- helper function
					- triggers this.setPositions()
					- returns Link's current length
			.setPositions(number)
				- calculates segment details, stored as object in Link.positions array
				- number represents (uses and/or sets) the Link.precision attribute
		- demos 96-100 for testing new routines finalised
		- added new attributes to SubScrawl:
			.path - SPRITENAME
			.pathPosition - number between 0 and 1
			.movePathPosition - (very small) number between 0 and 1
			.pathSpeedConstant - boolean - true for constant speed
			- can now very easily associate a sprite to a Shape sprite's path, for animation
			- amended SubScrawl.moveStart()
				- can now take 'path' value to 'automagically' advance sprite along path
				- no argument - does moveStart for .startX, .startY and .pathPosition
			- amended Scrawl.stamp()
				- will use .path value (if valid) in place of .startXY
					- pivot still has precedence (for drag and drop, etc)
			- various temporary demos to test coding
				- works!
	- added new Shape factories:
		- scrawl.makeEllipse()
			- produces ellipse Shapes
				- makes use of .radiusX, .radiusY attributes (not retained) to build ellipse
		- scrawl.makeRectangle()
			- produces rectangles with rounded corners
				- makes use of .width, .height to determine full width and height of sprite (not retained)
				- for corners (not retained):
					.radiusTopLeftX, .radiusTopLeftY, .radiusTopRightX, .radiusTopRightY
					.radiusBottomRightX, .radiusBottomRightY, .radiusBottomLeftX, .radiusBottomLeftY
					.radiusTopLeft, .radiusTopRight, .radiusBottomRight, .radiusBottomLeft
					.radiusTopX, .radiusTopY, .radiusBottomX, .radiusBottomY
					.radiusLeftX, .radiusLeftY, .radiusRightX, .radiusRightY
					.radiusTop, .radiusBottom
					.radiusRight, .radiusLeft
					.radiusX, .radiusY
					.radius
		- ISSUE - these new factory shapes are animating very slowly

130826
	- continuing work on path animation
		- hopefully will also lead to a new sprite factory - Oval (or Egg)
	
130825
	- started work on implementing functionality to allow a sprite to animate along a Shape path
		- lots of research on understanding maths behind bezier curves
		- began to add attributes and functions to Line object

		- more embarrassing, but a lot easier to do
		
130812
	- work on the index page continues
		- monor tweaks to various Scrawl.js functions to repair newly discovered bugs
		
130811
	- still working the website index page
		- got the non-canvas version working as designed
			- tested in IE9, FireFox, Chrome (on Windows7 laptop)
			- need better images!
	- started to re-import canvas routines
	
130810
	- developing new responsive website index page ...
		- got the basics in place - it responds to resizing as I want it to ...
		- all that's left to do is the carousel routines, and adding in the code for the various canvases
		- fixed bug in scrawl.getStack() 
		
130809
	- finished updating code base
		- major tinkerings with scrawl.makeLine(), .makeQuadratic(), .makeBezier()
			- all three now set their first point's .fixed attribute to the sprite's name
		- changes to some of the object constructors
		- overhaul of Shape object working, in particular for cloning Shape objects
			- changes to Point and Link object code
		- a shedload of fixes to demo code and scrawl.js code to fix all the stuff broken by the recoding exercise
	- tested all demos in browsers
		- Chrome
			- all demos work
			- animation: fast, smoothest
		- Firefox
			- all demos work
			- animation: fast
		- Safari
			- video issues (085)
			- all other demos work
			- animation: slow
		- IE10

			- cow image issue (054)
			- all other demos work
			- animation: slowest
	- all the changes have definitely broken the website index page!
		
130808
	- review of scrawl.js internal workings
		- decided to rationalise all the various existence tests included in the file
			- new scrawl.xt(item) - returns false if item is undefined; true otherwise
				- scrawl.xto([item,item,etc]) - returns false if all of the items are undefined
				- scrawl.xta([item,item,etc]) - returns false if any of the items are undefined
			- new scrawl.isa(item,string) - returns true if item is defined, and is of the type requested in the string
				- string can be:
					'bool', 'boolean'			- boolean
					'num', 'number'				- number
					'str', 'string'				- string
					'fn', 'func', 'function'	- js function object
					'arr', 'array'				- js array object
					'date'						- js date object
					'obj', 'object'				- user-defined object
		- started going through code base to update all neccessary lines to use these new functions
			- and also fix other inelegant/questionable code (eg get rid of all the try/catch stuff)
				
130807
	- attempted to redesign the website index page - abandoned
	
130806
	- working on Designs - gradients
		- rewrote a lot of the Design object tree
			- because gradients were boring
		- specifically: changed the Design.color attribute
			- now uses arrays of color point objects ... [{color: STRING, stop: NUMBER},{color: STRING, stop: NUMBER}, etc]
		- added gradient animations!!!
			- new Design.roll attribute added to color stop values to animate gradients
			- new Design.handleX, .handleY, .handleStartX, .handleStartY, .handleEndX, .handleEndY
				- for manipulating gradient start and end points
			- new Design.setDelta(), .makeGradient(), .sortStops(), .applyStops() helper functions
			- new Design.update() function to make gradient animations work
			- complete rewrite of Design, Gradient and RadialGradient constructors
			- fixed demos 029, 050
			- new demo091 (concentric, animated circles at mouse) to test gradient animation
			- new demo092 - move a spotlight over image (like in Gardens of Time)
			- unfixed bugs:
				- animations don't seem to work with all sprites
					- but always seem to work on sprites generated by cloning
				- using a color stop value of 1 can cause problems
					- workaround by using 0.9999 instead of 1
	- tested all demos in browsers
		- Firefox, Chrome - all good
		- Opera - all good except for the CSS3d stuff (and that damn cow)
		- Safari 
			- demo085 - won't display/play the video
			- otherwise, all good; even fixed demo029
		- IE10
			028 - backface visibility doesn't work
			029 - safari fix broke IE10; kludged a fix, but doesn't look as good as on other browsers
			032 - not doing the CSS3d stuff
			034 - selectors for clock still not working
			085 - won't display/play the video
			087 - definitely not a cube, but looks kinda pretty
	- NEED TO:
		- fix the index page - changes to Scrawl.js have broken it
		- rewrite the tutorial sections on ...
			- Starting Scrawl.js - automatic import of stacks, canvases, elements
			- Stacks
			- Gradients
		- update the documentation - now a serious job
		- when all that's done, upgrade to v0.209(beta)
		
130804-05
	- working on stacks stuff
		- new Scrawl.initialize() function for automatically populating the library object when starting Scrawl.js
			- Scrawl.getCanvas() replaced by .getCanvases() helper function
			- new Scrawl.getStacks(), .getElements() helper functions
			- scans for any element on page with class='scrawlstack'
				- imports them as stacks
				- sets all children of stack elements to position:absolute
			- scans for canvas elements
				- checks to see if parent element is stack
				- if element has class="stack:STACKNAME", appends canvas to stack element
					- if stack doesn't exist, creates it
			- scans for elements with classes='scrawl stack:STACKNAME'
				- moves found elements into named stack
		- edited Scrawl.addCanvasToPage(), .addStackToPage()
		- developed demo090 for testing initialization changes
	- big overhaul of the Cell object
		- added Cell.usePadDimensions (boolean), Cell.getPadWidth(), Cell.getPadHeight()
		- rewrote Cell constructor, Cell.copyCellToSelf()
		- added Cell.set()
	- overhaul of stack scaling
		- mainly to get the frogger demo (083) working
			- also fixed the kill frog bug in demos082-3
	- CSS3d tinkering
		- fixed all CSS3d demos
			- except for 087 (spinning cube) - not working in IE10, but at least it looks pretty
			- 034 (kaleidoscope clock) - can't get selectors to work in IE10
			- 028 spinning card - backfaceVisibility:hidden not working for IE10
			- 029 cat animation in 3d environment - not positioned correctly in Safari
	
130803
	- MAJOR changes
		- revising CSS3d stuff
		- complete rewrite of Stack, Element, Pad constructors and functions
		- rewriting all the routines for automatically picking up canvases, elements, stacks when starting Scrawl.js
		- all CSS3d stuff now placed into Scrawl3d object
			- parent: SubScrawl; children: Stack, Element, Pad
		- got everything except the stack demos working again
			- broken: 001, 002, 028, 029, 030, 031, 032, 033, 034, 083, 087
				- also: frogger game demos (082, 083) - frog still moves after killed
	- need to redo linking between stacks, pads and elements
	- need to redo functions for
		- creating new stacks
		- creating new canvas elements
		- moving canvases and elements into stacks
		
130802
	- tinkering ... not happy with the whole stack thing
		- need to think more about importing canvases, elements
		- what gets turned into a stack, when, why, how
		- will mean breaking the library, but what the heck ...
		
130801
	- divided the Scrawl function into 2 separate objects, one inheriting from the other
		- purpose: not every child needs all the functionality
		- Scrawl looks after name, title, comment, get(), set(), clone(), toString()
		- SubScrawl looks after everything else
		- inheriting from Scrawl:
			- SubScrawl; Context; Image; AnimSheet; Design (Gradient, RadialGradient, Pattern)
		- inheriting from SubScrawl:
			- Stack (Pad, Element); Cell; Group; Sprite (Block, Phrase, Picture, Wheel, Shape); Point; Link
		- decided there's no need to mention this stuff in the tutorial
	- minor edit to scrawl.getCanvas() to fix variable detritus ending up in the global scope thingy
	- upgrade to version 0.208b
	- updated documentation
			
130731
	- finalised demo087
		- tweaked scrawl.addNewCanvas() - now does a set() on the new Pad object

		- added a demo list section
	- uploaded revised website
	- uploaded new version to Sourceforge
	- sprite rolling: Phrase, Picture, Block
		- moved sprite attributes - roll, degree, angleDegrees - into Sprite constructor
			- so Phrase, Picture, Block inherit them
			- angleDegrees is the Shape version of sprite.degree
				- ancient error that needs to be rectified!
		- new sprite helper functions: sprite.rotateCell(canvasContextObject, CELLNAMEstring), .unrotateCell(sameasbefore)
		- recoded all the Phrase, Picture, Block stamping functions to take into account roll values
			- .clear(), .draw(), .fill(), drawFill(), .fillDraw(), .floatOver(), .sinkInto()
		- coded up demos 088, 089 - to test the new functionality
		- recoded demo087 to make use of new functionality
		- checked all other demos to see if anything broke
			- broke the clock and vector demos (034, 059)
				- also broke the clock on the index page
				- fixed by adding new sprite.rollable attribute
					- default = true; false blocks the sprite interfering with cell roll functionality
					- in other words, if a sprite is stamped on a rotated cell, best set rollable to false to save headaches
					- only pertinent for Phrase, Picture, Block
	- upgrade to version 0.207b
	- updated ducumentation
	- updated tutorial page

			- all attributes required - no defaults!
	- recoded Picture.checkHit(object)
		- where object includes
			x: NUMBER (required)

	- (re)fixed Cell.rotateCell()
	- scrawl.imageDataWebWorker officially dumped
	- updated documentation
		- upgraded version to v0.021(b)
	- updated website
		- checked all Examples and Demos in firefox
	- uploaded new version to SourceForge
				
130507
	-complete overhaul of collisions
		- no longer using image data tables (for anything!)
		- substantial rewrite of a number of functions dealing with collisions and detection
		- Cell objects now get additional groups - CELLNAME_field, CELLNAME_fence
			- rewrite of Cell constructor and Sprite functions associated with assigning sprites to field/fence
			- retired Cell.field, Cell.fence attributes
		- demo060 now working
			- color picker demos not working
			- drag and drop broken
			
130506
	- recoded Cell.transformCell() to accept absolute (not relative) values
		- fits in with Scrawl's 'absolute, not relative' worldview re cell transforms
	- finished coding Group.getSpriteXYRange() functions
	- experimenting with collisions - sprites as 'fields' and 'fences'
		- added Cell.fence array
		- rewrote scrawl.buildFields(), cell.buildField(), Sprite constructor, Sprite.setSpriteToCellFields(), Sprite.setSpriteToCellFences()
		- the results work for Block, Wheel, Shape
			- had to fix bug in the scrawl.makeXYZ factory methods for lines and curves (.closed always defaulted to 'true')
		- cloned sprites weren't registering as fields or fences
			- rewrote Sprite.clone() to accommodate .field and .fence attributes in the clone argument object
				- can't clone them directly - .field and .fence are attributes of the Cell object, not the Sprite object
		- should work for Picture and Phrase - needs to be tested
		- results take (a lot of) time to calculate
			- maybe make use of the web worker?
				- tried it, breaks code - possibly use a callback function in Cell.getImageData?
			- thinking of using multi-channel fields (red, green, blue) - takes just as long to calculate 3 tables as it does one.
		- coded up demo060 for experimenting with fields/fences
	
130505
	- completed cell positional animation section of tutorial
		- moved Example12 (parallax scrolling) over to demo052
		- updated index page - removed Examples01, 12
	- moved Examples 02 (curves as shapes), 03 (holes in shapes), 04 (basic text), 06 (svg cow) to tutorial 
		- as demo053, 054, 055, 056
		- updated index page to remove Ex02, 03, 04, 06
	- moved (now) Example03 (spinning lines) to tutorial as demo057

	- completed the animations section of the tutorial page
	- upgraded Scrawl.js to v0.0203(b)
	- updated documentation
	- updated website
	- uploaded new version to SourceForge
	
130504
	- new scrawl library functions and attributes:
		- getImageDataValue(table, items, varY)
			- where table = nameoftable string
			- items = object containing x and y attribute
			- or items = number = x coordinate, varY = number = y coordinate
			- includes error capture - returns false if:
				- table doesn't (yet) exist
				- arguments not good
				- coordinates out of bounds
		- .imageDataWebWorker
			- path to the imageDataWebWorker.js file; default is null
	- amended Cell.getImageData() to look for scrawl.imageDataWebWorker
		- will use web worker when found; otherwise uses getImageData helper functions
	- updated demo018, Example006 (both color at mouse cursor demos); example015 (cloning sprites)
		- all now make use of web worker
		- demo018 and Ex006 make use of scrawl.getImageDataValue()
	- updated Picture section of tutorial to explain how to use these inovations
	- completed drag-and-drop section of the tutorial
		- Example015 recoded as demo050; removed from index page
	- added Cell.setDelta() function for sourceXYWH, targetXYWH attributes
	- working on cell positional animation section of the tutorial
		- Example01 (cell animation) recoded as Demo051
	
130503
	- fixed Chrome issue of leaving a blank line at the top of canvas
		- amended Sprite.getStartXY functions - were adding 0.5 to positions
	- coding Example07 (drag and drop) over as Example049
		- fixed bugs in Picture.checkHit
			- returns false if xy values are out of bounds for the dataImage array
			- makes calculated xy values integers before test
		- removed Ex07 from index page; renumbered other examples
	- investigating the use of web workers to speed up imageDataTables creation
		- or at least to stop the process stalling the rest of page layout and javascript stuff
		- significant changes to Cell.getImageData() function
			- added Cell.saveDataTables() and Cell.buildDataTables() functions
			- new javascript file - imageDataWebWorker.js
				- need to figure out ways of either internalising this file, or devising ways for coder to tell Scrawl where file lives
		
130502
	- fixed demo047
		- added new Group functions: .setHandles(), .getSpriteXRange(), .getSpriteYRange()
		- amended Group.stamp(), Sprite.stamp()
			- GROUPNAMEs can now be used as a pivot
			- Group handleXY can be set using Group.setHandles({x: value, y: value})
				- where x: 'left', 'center', 'right', or number
				- where y: 'top', 'center', 'bottom', or number
			- Group.groupXY attributes can now be used for collision detection with cell field
	- Example018 broken (probably from yesterday's changes to Picture.clone() function)
		- now fixed; checked against demo047 - still works
	- other broken stuff - pivoted labels: demo007, demo013, demo014,
		- (but not 027, 036, 046)
		- fixed - minor amendments to Group.stamp() and Sprite.stamp()
	- tutorial page
		- finished coding up animating sprites, sprite pivots, sprite-to-mouse sections
			- moved Example003 (blue wheel at mouse) over to demo048
			- removed Example001 (spinning icons around group animation) - not as clear as demo047
			- renumbered Examples on index page
	- thinking about accessibility issues (after reading http://blog.smartbear.com/software-quality/bid/283454/All-About-HTML5?utm_source=html5weekly&utm_medium=email)
		- added new .title and .comment attribute to the Scrawl object
			- allows all Scrawl objects to have text titles and comments attached to them 
				- might be of some help as would allow eg
					- javascript to speak out titles/comments when mouse hovers over a sprite?
					- dynamic 'tooltip' substitutes?
	- updated documentation
		- upgraded Scrawl.js to v0.0202(b)
	- updated website
		- testing live site in browsers:
			- in all browsers
				- Example03 (curves) - not triggering when user first clicks on button; repeated clicks on button breaks up the lines
			- Firefox
				- all working as expected (no surprise)
			- Safari (windows)
				- Example06 (color under mouse) - stalling (though no problems in demo018, which repeats the color under mouse thingy)
				- Example08 (svg cow) - taking its time to load
				- all demos - insist on opening in new browser instance, not new tab (local preferences issue?)
				- demo029 - cat running behind ground - zIndex issue?
			- IE10
				- demos with text - text seems thinner than in other browsers (maybe include more reliable IE friendly font in font attribute?)
				- demo028 (cards on y axis spin) - backface visibility issue not resolved
				- demo032 (HTML elements) - some ghosting on spinning elements
			- Opera
				- Still hates the SVG cow (Ex08)
				- Example012 (carousel) - painfully slow (on fast PC)
				- CSS3d in stacks - not implemented in Opera
				- generally slower on the animations compared to other browsers
			- Chrome
				- demo032 (animating HTML elements in stack) - runs very, very slowly
				- demo017-018, 037 (copies part of image to Picture) - leaving visible white line at top of canvas
	- uploaded new version to SourceForge
	
130501
	- added new functionality to Point.fixed attribute
		- setting attribute to SPRITENAME string will make the sprite act like the point's pivot
		- coded demo046 to demonstrate it - user-defined bezier curve
		- added text and demo to tutorial page
	- working on demo047, Group.setHandles() - not shifting group sprites as expected ...
		- tinkered with a new Picture.clone() function
		
130430
	- cleaned up the main.js file for the website index page
	- NAMECHANGE: 
		- Cell.rotation changed to Cell.roll
		- Cell.rotationDegree changed to Cell.rollDegree
			- to match up with the rest of Scrawl
	- tutorial page 
		- completed display cycle sections
		- started work on animation sections
			- fixed small bug in Sprite.checkField() - was over-compensating for block handles
			- coded up demo041-43 - uses Examples 1 (block anim), 6 (star anim) and 19 (pivot points anim)
			- removed Examples 1, 6 and 19 from Index page.
			- removed Example 11 (sprite order) from index page - too boring for words
			- added demo44
			- moved Example16 (snake) to demo045 - Examples 17-19 renumbered
		- animation cycle and animating sprites sections completed
	
130429
	- completed display cycle sections of the tutorial page
		- used demo034, demo037 in the display cycle section
		- recoded Group.stamp(), Sprite.stamp(), Sprite.forceStamp()
			- so they only take one argument: either a method string, or an override object
			- tested all Examples and demos in Firefox - working fine
		
130428
	- completed colours and gradients section of the tutorial page
		- fixed bug in Gradient.makeDesign()
		- moved Examples01 and 02 over to tutorials page (as demo039, demo040)
			- other Examples renumbered.
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
130427
	- Two Month Anniversary!
	- fixed Example17 - vectors
		- tested in Firefox, IE10, Safari-for-Windows - works
	- fixed demo027 - rotating star
	- fixed demo034 - kaliedoscope clock
	- fixed Example19 - kaliedoscope clock
	- fixed Example20 - parallax scrolling
		- all issues were being caused by poor coding in the Point constructor - fixed!
	- completed making shapes section of tutorial page
	- simplified the Image object
		- much of this stuff now overtaken by Stack/Element
	- upgraded Scrawl.js to version 0.02(b)
		- all the stack and element work deserves such an upgrade
			- need to finish collision stuff before going for v0.1(b)
	- updated documentation
	- updated website
	- uploaded to SourceForge
	- demo037 - magnifier effect
	- demo038 - carousel selector
		- to show off on Twitter ...
		
130426
	- tutorial page
		- finished of stack section
			- moved Example 20 into tutorial as demo34
		- started making shapes section
			- new demos 35, 36
	- somehow managed to break the shape-making factory method while fixing a bug in the Point.setPolar() method
		- Example 17 (vectors), 19 (kclock), 20 (scrolling)
		- Demo 27, 34
			- vectors should be easy to fix ???! - do similar to demo 36 (which works very well)
			- kaleidoscope clock hands too thin and short
			- stars in parallax scrolling, star in drag/drop demo - badly out of shape
		- can't go back to what was there before - bug was testing for 0 rather than null
			- causes big problems when it comes to polar points based around a startXY of 0,0
		
130425
	- tutorial page
		- shifted Example21 into tutorial page (as demo33)
		- added Element.setDimensions() function
	- fixed mouse tracking bug for canvases in stacks
		- added Stack.displayOffsetX, .displayOffsetY, .setDisplayOffsets()
		- amended Pad.setDisplayOffsets() to take into account DOM changes
		- amended scrawl.getCanvas() etc - DOM changes (specific to Scrawl.js) should trigger Pad.displayOffsetXY recalculations
			
130424
	- continuing to write up Tutorial pages
		- stack page
			- added new Pad.setPerspective(), .setPerspectiveOrigin() functions
				- just for IE
	- added functions:
		- Stack.set(), Pad.set(), Pad.setDelta()
			- setDelta covers pitch, yaw, roll, translateZ, top, left
	- importing HTML elements into a scrawl stack
		- decided this needs to be done on specific stacks
			- new Stack functions: addElementById(), addElementsByStackName()
			- for the stackname function to work, elements need to include a class along the lines of 'stack_STACKNAME'
		- added a new Class object: Element
			- wrapper for all elements imported into the stack
			- new library attributes: scrawl.element, scrawl.elm, scrawl.elementnames
			- Element objects do much the same re CSS3d as Pad objects
				- mostly the same attributes; mostly the same functions
		- coded up demo032 to road test the new stuff - seems to work in browsers
			- painfully slow in Chrome (a surprise)
			- animations leave some trails on IE (no surprise)
			- works well in Firefox
			- imports work in Opera, but not CSS3d animations (no change there)
			- works fine in Windows Safari (bound to be some z-index issues, though)
		- need to recode Example021 to take on board these new developments
			- and get rid of the existing Image functions for importing/manipulating images on top of the canvas
				- which were/are no more than an ugly kludge
		- can also reconsider recoding Example020?
			- biggest problem for both is the existing index HTML layout - currently no stack on the index page!!!
			
130423
	- working on an animated cat over a 3D(ish) terrain
		- lots of corrections to functions coded yesterday
		- lots of research re Firefox CSS3d and drawing order (z-index) interactions
		- animation works in IE10, Firefox (finally), Chrome
			- but not Safari, nor Opera (which doesn't do the CSS3d thingy yet)
	- new functions
		- Cell.spliceCell() - for scrolling cells
			- recoded Example22 to take advantage of the new spliceCell function
		- Pad.setTranslateZ() - just seems to be another form of scaling ...
	- upgraded Scrawl.js to version 0.013(b) 
		- still need to complete the fields stuff before going for 0.02 (or even 0.1? There's not a lot more core stuff to be done)
	- updated documentation
	- updated website
	- uploaded latest version to SourceForge
	
130421-22
	- playing with css3d, trying to work out ways of integrating it into Scrawl.js
		- can also change stacking order by altering a (new) Pad.order attribute
			- Pad.order === <canvas> element.style.zIndex value
		- amended scrawl.getCanvas() function
			- if a <canvas> element has a class attribute class="stack:STACKNAME"
				- will create a div element atack with the stackname, if doesn't already exist
				- will setup (new) div so it can handle css3d transformations in its child elements
					- if user specifies existing (non-stack) element, up to them to create the css3d environment
				- will move canvas element to div element, styling it so css3d operartions can be performed/displayed by it
			- amended Pad constructor
				- stacked display canvas elements given id=NAME_display
			- with no stack class, Pad is created in the classical way
		- amended the Array.contains() function - will now also search for items that match a regular expression
			- if it finds a match, will return the first matching item, rather than true
		- amended scrawl.addCanvasToPage() function
			- every canvas added dynamically will automatically be given a css3d envoronment
			- specifying stackName argument for stack div that already exists - canvas will be assigned to that stack
		- added scrawl.addStackToPage() helper function
	- changed Shape.skew to Shape.roll across all files
	- added Wheel.roll attribute
		- amended various Wheel functions to make use of this attribute
		- updated demo011
	- added new Stack object
		- keeps track of perspective, perspective-origin & overflow style attributes on the containing stack div
		- also sniffs for IE so can trigger copying of perspective attributes to canvases (if needed)
		- new Stack functions: setPerspective(), setDimensions(), setOverflow(), setPerspectiveOrigin()
	- added new Pad functions: getBackfaceVisibility(), setBackfaceVisibility()
		- backfaceVisibility playing up in IE
	- more new Pad functions: 
		- getTransformStyle(), setTransformStyle(), getOrder(), setOrder() - for z-index
		- setPitch(), setYaw(), setRoll()
		- getTop(), setTop(), getLeft(), setLeft(), setPosition() - last takes (x, y), or ({x:number, y:number})
	
130420
	- investigating possibilities of including css3d in Scrawl.js
	- experiments prove that canvases can do css3d stuff
	- fixed scrawl.render() bug
		- if passed no arguments, scrawl will iterate through all pads listed in scrawl.padnames and get them to render
		- fixed same bug in scrawl.clear(), scrawl.compile(), scrawl.show()
	- possible roadmap:
		- add perspective attribute to Pad object
			- perspective: true - triggers DOM reconstruction to give Pad ability to do 3d transforms
		- need some sort of stack so that Pads can be displayed over each other
		- aim for the simpler stuff: yaw, pitch, roll
			- where roll=skew=clock rotation (around z axis)
			- yaw = left-right movement = horizontal rotation (movement along x axis)
			- pitch = up-down movement = vertical rotation (movement along y axis)
	
130419
	- new bug? - animations only display their ongoing results when mouse is in motion.
		- can't get bug to repeat itself
	- amended Shape.checkHit() - to take (x, y, test) as well as {x:val, y:val, test:val}
	- amended Shape.setStartTo() - to take (x, y) as well as {x:val, y:val}
	- writing up tutorial pages for the website
		- 'Shape' page completed
		- Demo027 coded
	- upgrade to version 0.0123b
	- updated documentation
	- updated website
	- uploaded latest version to SourceForge

130418
	- IE mouse position issue:
		- think I've solved it - probably a html layout problem
			- web page uses css tables, which expand/contract
			- set a min-width on the navigation cell, which stops unexpected contractions
				- firefox takes table instabilities into account when calculating mouse position; IE doesn't
		- also moved the window.onmousemove event into Scrawl
			- new scrawl.handleMouseMove() function
			- called whenever user calls Pad.getMouse()
	- writing up tutorial pages for the website
		- 'Picture with sprite sheet' page completed
		- 'Shape' page started
		- Demo019-026 coded
		- fixed scrawl.makeQuadratic() bug
	- changed Shape.delta attribute to Shape.skew
	- changed Vector object to Link object
		- lesson learned: choose the right names for things before coding the big javascript library!
	- updated documentation
			
130417
	- writing up tutorial pages for the website
		- fixed Scrawl.set() to return this
		- fixed Sprite.set()
		- 'Phrase' page completed
		- Demo012-015 coded
		- 'Picture' page completed
		- Demo016-018 coded
	- upgrade version to 0.0122(b)
	- update documentation
	- update website
	- upload new version to SourceForge
		
130416
	- writing up tutorial pages for the website
		- added Scrawl.toString() method - returns JSON.stringify(this)
			- can adapt this (later) to include ctx/design objects for cells and sprites, point/vector objects for Shapes, anim objects, etc
			- could be the foundation for save/load operations???
		- 'Scrawl library' page completed
		- 'Block' page completed
		- 'Wheel' page completed
		- Demo004-011 coded
		- amended Sprite.setDelta() to cover startAngle, endAngle attributes
	- updated documentation
	- updated website
	- loaded latest version to sourceforge
	- checked Examples in IE10
		- mouse location bug hasn't gone away
		- for most part, seems only to affect x (horizontal) position, not y
	- fixed wheel emboss bug
		- renamed 'emboss' drawing function to 'sinkInto'
		- introduced new sprite drawing function - 'floatOver'
			- all affected methods updated
			- all new methods added where required
			- local index and tutorial web pages updated
			
130415
	- tackled mouse position problem
		- now using code lifted from quirksmode website to keep track of mouse coordinates
		- seems to have fixed the problem in IE9 (on laptop)
			- not yet tested on other browsers
	- started mapping out a possible tutorial page for the website
		- added scrawl.addCanvasToPage(), Pad.makeCurrent() functions
			- for adding canvas elements dynamically to a webpage, and drawing to them
		- Demo001-003 coded
		- 'HTML5 page' completed
			
130414
	- added new pivot test to Sprite.stamp()
		- if pivot === 'mouse' - set sprite's startXY to the mouse coordinates in relation to pad being stamped to
		- updated Sprite.pickupSprite(), Sprite.dropSprite() functions to use pivot:'mouse'
		- updated those Examples where a sprite is attached to the mouse cursor
	- amended Cell object - changed .pads attribute to .pad
		- big change, as decided against cells contributing to more than one Pad object
			- placing a cellname in a Pad's cells array could achieve the same thing as the old .pads[] thingy?
				- Pad.clear(), Pad.compile() - use Pad.cells to determine which cells to clear/compile
				- Pad.show() - will only use cells listed in Pad.drawOrder (if drawOrder.length > 0)
			- added Pad.addCells(string||[string]) function to add cellnames to Pad.cells and Pad.drawOrder
				- will check that cells exist before adding them to attributes
				- I 'think' Sprite.stamp() should be okay with this arrangement?
					- uses cells listed in Group.cells to determine which cells to stamp on
					- each cell only lists one pad to which it contributes
					- uses that padname to call Pad.getMouse() when Sprite.pivot === 'mouse'
						- which means Sprite will only attach to mouse on the cell's designated Pad object!?
				- NONE OF THIS YET TESTED
	- started coding up new Phrase functions: getMetrics(); checkHit()
		- getMetrics() estimates text height - will no doubt run into problems when users choose to use em, %, etc
			- seems to work okay for pt and px
		- checkHit takes into account textBaseline and textAlign settings for the Phrase
			- NOT TESTED beyond textBaseline:alphabetic && textAlign:left
	- tested all the Examples in various browsers (on fast PC)
		- Safari
			- timed animations: 50-55fps
			- glitch during Ex26? Browser hung when mouse reentered canvas. Couldn't get it to repeat, so discounting it for now
			- Ex27 loaded in 1.1 secs
		- Opera
			- timed animations: 32-36fps
			- Ex15 - not displaying cow properly - problem with SVG file??
			- Ex17 - arrow out by x:-5px - fine on reload, couldn't get it to repeat ... glitch??
			- Ex21 - again image out by x:10px - possibly a Pad.getMouse() problem? Fine when repeated Example
			- Ex27 loaded in 1.4 secs
		IE10
			- mouse is definitely out by varying amounts across various Examples
				- NEED TO REVISIT getting mouse coordinates code
			- timed animations consistent at 64fps
			- Ex27 loaded in 0.8 secs
		- Chrome
			- Glitched once on Ex26 (carousel) - couldn't get problem to replicate - click issue?
			- Ex27 loaded in 1.4 secs
			- some sort order issues on Ex26 sprite display (all originals & clones have order=0 except when atMouse (before being pasted)
				- sort order changes result in some flicker in overlapping sprites
				- easily fixed in Example ...
			- still the smoothest scrolling for all browsers
		- Firefox
			- all as expected (Firefox is my goto browser during development)
			- Ex27 loaded in 1.7 secs
	- upgraded version to 0.012(b)
	- updated documentation
	- uploaded revisions to website
	- uploaded new version to SourceForge
		
130413
	- added Number.prototype.isBetween(val1, val2, boolean)
		- got fed up doing islessThan or isGreaterThan comparisons
		- when boolean set to true, test is minVal <= testVal <= maxVal === true
		- otherwise test is minVal < testVal < maxVal === true
			- also returns true if minVal === testVal === maxVal
		- amended several Examples to make use of this feature
	- added Sprite.pickupSprite(), Sprite.dropSprite() functions
		- allows for sprites to be picked up without initial movement
		- amended Example14 to make use of these functions
	- coded new Example27 to test cloning and collision detection across all Scrawl sprites
		- coded up Shape.clone function - overrides sprite.clone
			- also clones points and vectors, and sets everything up so the cloned sprite is a completely separate entity from its parent
		- amended Picture.getImageData(), Picture.checkHit()
			- so that sprites with animation sheets only register hits on the painted bits, not the surrounding box
			- requires user to call .getImageData() on the sprite before starting the collision detection stuff
	- updated documentation
	
130412
	- fixed bug in Sprite.clone()
	- amended Example03 to demonstrate getter/setter methods
	- updated documentation
	- new version: 0.011(beta) - will move to .02(b) when the collision detection stuff is more complete
	- updated website with revised example codes
		- tested live website against browsers
			- Firefox - everything works as expected at good speed (on high spec PC)
			- Safari(Windows) - still as jittery as ever, but everything works
			- Opera - slightly slower than Firefox, but better than has been - does NOT like Ex15; Ex17 also touch-and-go
			- IE10 - mostly fine (and fast!)
				- still got the issue with Ex15 - arrow does not clear from screen between angles +/- 60-120
				- Ex20 - not able to use selectors with the mouse, only through arrows/tab/return keys
			- Chrome - fast, smooth, works entirely as expected
	- uploaded new version to SourceForge
	- fixed 'bug' in Ex20
		- IE really hates styling added dynamically via style element - all other tested browsers were fine with it
		- solved by moving style stuff into the css file
	- fixed 'bug' in Ex15
		- made the arrow cell 1000x1000 - big enough not to send IE into hissyfits when the cell is rotated
	- updated website
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
130411
	- finished fixing Example17
		- amended Phrase.deconstructFont() to fix font errors
	- updated Examples 16, 18-22, 24-26 for the mouse tracking and webpage animation improvements 
	- developing fields - 2D true/false arrays associated with cells
		- for use as bounding boxes and the like
			- uses sprites to determine which field elements are set to true
		- added field{} to the library - fields will have same name as their associated cells
		- added Cell.field attribute - an array of spritenames used to build the field
			- though single sprites can be entered as a string rather than an array
			- the boolean value 'true' can also be used
				- sets all the elements in the cell's field to true
		- added Cell.buildField() for constructing and populating scrawl.field entities
			- either sets all field elements to true (when it encounters the boolean value 'true')
			- or iterates through sprites in the field array and uses them to determine which field elements to set to true
				- so far only coded for Block sprites (which form squares)
				- Picture sprites will be able to use an alphaTable to set the field
				- Wheel, Phrase and Shape sprites - no decisions yet taken on how to handle these
		- added Sprite.setSpriteToCellFields(cells)
			- where:
				cell = true - add sprite to current pad's current cell's field array
				cell = string - add sprite to the named cell's field array
				cell = [string] - add sprite to all listed cells' field arrays
			- called as part of the sprite constructor, when a 'field' attribute is passed to it
		- added Cell.checkFieldAt() to return values from field at coordinatesXY
			- will accept (x, y), or ({x:n, y:n}), or spritename
				- amended Sprite.getStartXY functions to allow them being called without an override
		- added Sprite.checkField() function
			- uses getStartXY() for the checking point - thus affected by handleXY and scale values
			- will check against all of its group's cells
			- returns an object composed of cellname:boolean pairs
	- testing new fields thingy in Example03
		- added new methods to Block and Picture: getWidth(); getHeight(); getEndX(); getEndY()
	- testing in Example04
		- changed group.deltaXY to group.groupXY
		- added group.getGroupX(), group.getGroupY()
		- added group.checkField() method
	- updated Examples 03-04, 08 for fields and boundary testing

130410
	- decided to internalise MouseXY coordinates
		- new pad function .getMouse() 
			- returns XY coords offset from topleft of display canvas
			- also returns active: true if mouse is over the canvas
			- makes use of moustrack event listener added to scrawl file, but not part of scrawl library (like requestAnimFrame)
		- updated Examples 03-17 that involving mouse tracking 
			- except Example 16
			- currently debugging Example 17
	- spent a lot of time working out an effective method for killing animations when user presses an Example button (on website)
		- solved by making sure every animation routine has an off switch
			- either a counter set for 1000 frames
			- or a doAnimation[] flag
				- Examples set doAnimation[n] to true
				- Animation function only runs while doAnimation[n] remains true
				- in cleanup between Examples, doAnimation reset to []
			
130409
	- revisited Example14 - dragAndDrop
		- added new method to Group object - Group.getSpriteAt({x, y, sheet, test})
			- sheet = 'alpha', 'red', 'green', etc - imageDataTable to be checked
			- test = numerical value 
				- Picture: minimum value of (eg alpha level) check that needs to be passed for true result
				- Wheel: additional distance to be added (subtracted for negative values) to sprite's radius for the check
				- Shape: actual radius from Shape.startXY to use for the check
				- Block: not taken into account (only does box collision detection)
				- Phrase: not yet coded up the checkHit for phrase objects
		- amended Picture.checkHit so it can check imageData tables for hits, if requested by user
	- updated Example25 for the new group checking routines
	- developed Example26 - colliding balls and stars - to test wheel/shape sprite collision detection
		- added Wheel.checkHit() function
	- coded Shape.checkHit()
		- if test value supplied, use that as radius for circle collision test
		- otherwise, use longest start/end point distance value as the radius
	- coded Shape.getRadius()
		- returns the effective radius of a shape sprite
			- ie: the longest distance between a start/end point and the Shape.startXY values
		- Shape.getRadius(true) returns the scaled effective radius
	- upgraded Scrawl.js to version 0.0105(beta)
	- updated documentation
	- updated website
	- uploaded new version to SourceForge
	- NEW IE-related bug uncovered - Example20 - browser makes it difficult to use select dropdowns ...
		
130408
	- decided to remove property error checking stuff
		- Scrawl.checkValues() method removed
		- Scrawl.set() method amended
		- all objects inheriting from scrawl modified to remove the error check
	- moved scale property into Sprite object
		- removed scale from Phrase and Shape objects - now inherited from Sprite
		- amended Context.getChanges for scaling
			- 'lineWidth', 'shadowOffsetX', 'shadowOffsetY', 'shadowBlur' all now scale
				- unexpected, but tolerable, consequences for updated Example06
	- updating Examples
		- adapted Example06 to use scale, Pad.displayOffsetXY
		- adapted Example07 to use Pad.displayOffsetXY
		- adapted Example12 to use Pad.displayOffsetXY
		- adapted Example14 to use Pad.displayOffsetXY
		- adapted Example15 to use scale, Pad.displayOffsetXY
		- adapted Example16 to use Pad.displayOffsetXY
		- adapted Example17 to use Pad.displayOffsetXY
		- adapted Example18 to use Pad.displayOffsetXY
	- added Sprite.checkHit(x, y) method - returns false
		- for collision detection
		- coded Block.checkHit(), Picture.checkHit()
			- use simple (xy) in-box collision detection
			- takes into account handle offsets and scaling
	- completed Example25 - carousel selector
		- checked in websites:
			- fine in Firefox and IE10
			- works well in Chrome, except for delays on the click events
			- a bit slow in Safari
			- barely works in Opera
	- upgraded Scrawl to version 0.0104(beta)
	- updated documentation
	- updated website
	- uploaded to SourceForge

130407
	- developing Example25 - a carousel selector
		- experimented with stretching shapes into ovals 
			- abandoned - wasn't achieving the effect I wanted
		- experimented with sprite handles
	- no changes made to Scrawl.js
	
130406
	- added pivot attribute to Sprite object
		- pivot is the name of a point object
		- when present, sprite will set its startXY attributes to point currentXY values
		- added new method - 'none' to Sprite object
		- added override method 'none' to Shape object
			- doesn't draw shape, but will update currentXY values of its constituent points
	- developed Example23 to demonstrate the use of pivots and invisible sprites
		- rehash of example08
	- adapted new pivot feature to also accept a sprite name (for sprite.startXY) as a legitimate value
		- developed Example24 to demonstrate the feature
	- added a forceStamp() method to the Sprite object
		- allows sprites with visibility = false to be stamped into the scene
	- checked browsers
		- IE (10 - updated itself automatically yesterday) doesn't like Example17!
	- upgraded to version 0.0103(beta)
	- updated documentation
	- updated website
	- uploaded to SourceForge
	
130405
	- fixed bugs
		- IE was clipping Ex21 svg image rather than resizing it
			- fixed by editing svg file to include viewBox attribute in the <svg> element
		- all browsers were failing to position elements over the canvas browser correctly
			- only occurred when viewing Ex20 & Ex21 on the live website
			- fixed by changing the index.html <section> tag to a regular <div> tag
		- no amendments to Scrawl.js required to fix bugs
		- restored Examples 20-21 to the website
	- coded a parallax scrolling example (as Example22)
		- added backgroundColor attribute to Cell objects
		- amended Cell.compile() to draw the background color, if defined
		- tested new example in browsers - all okay
	- updated documentation
	- moved to version 0.0102(beta)
	- updated website
	- uploaded to SourceForge
			
130404
	- experimented with Example15 (as Example21)
		- get image to display directly over canvas element
	- extended the Pad object to handle experimental outfall
		- now includes: displayOffsetX; displayOffsetY; displayWidth; displayHeight
			- collects this data from the display cell during construction
		- setDisplayOffsets() - for setting/recalculating new attributes
	- extended the Image object to handle experiments
		- added attributes: startX; startY, handleX, handleY, offsetX, offsetY
			- offsetXY taken directly from image's Pad object
			- startXY can be used for directly positioning Image over (not in) canvas
			- handleXY - values between 0-1 for offsetting Image relative to startXY
				- this is DIFFERENT to how sprites and cells use their handleXY attributes
		- added functions: getHandle(); changeDimensions(); update(); addOverPad()
			- all for handling image over canvas operations
	- updated documentation
	- tested in browsers
		- Example21 currently not working correctly in IE9
	- moved to version 0.0101(beta)
	- uploaded to SourceForge
	- updated website
		- examples 20 & 21 not working as expected on live website - hidden from view for now
			- something's wrong with the absolute positioning of elements over the canvas
		
130403
	- adapted Example19 (as Example20) to add HTML form controls
	- no changes made to Scrawl.js

130402
	- investigated ways of turning Kaleidoscope Clock into an app
		- website version works on Kindle Fire
		- scrawl.js (mostly) working after appification via Android SDK/Eclipse
			- initial frame not cleared when testing on virtual phone emulations
			- initial setup skips a fair number of frames
	- no changes to scrawl.js made to facilitate, or as a result of, the experiments

130401
	- developing standalone version of the Kaleidoscope Clock
		- added click-to-change kaleidoscope feature
		- made it resizable
		- fixed bugs 
			- can't work out how to stop segments 'wandering' over time
	- added feature to Wheel object to create slices
	- updated documentation
	
130331
	- developed and deployed Example19 - the Kaleidoscope Clock
		- involves cell rotation, translation, scaling
			- for the flipping of sprites
		- tested in browsers
		- updated documentation
		- uploaded to website
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
130330
	- AnimSheet object completed
		- anim{}, animnames[] added to scrawl library
			- scrawl.reset() amended
			- Scrawl.checkValues updated
		- Picture object substantially amended to handle sprite sheets
			- new functions: getImage(); changeAnimSheet(); setAnimSheetAction(); getRunningState()
			- new property: animSheet
	- added an 'avoid checking' flag to all constructor argument lists
		- new objects can be built/cloned without excessively checking variables
	- developed Example018 to test spritesheet animation
	- tested all Examples across browsers
		- everything renders as expected
		- Chrome gives the smoothest animations
		- Chrome, Firefox, IE9 are all around the 60fps mark (on high-spec PC)
		- Safari (windows) is slower - 45-50fps
		- Opera is very, very slow - 30fps on even the most basic animation
		- things are slower on the laptop - Firefox runs at ~ 50fps
	- updated documentation
	- think I've covered enough of the basics to move to v0.01(beta) ...

130329
	- working on sprite sheets
		- lots of coding; lots of abandoned ideas
		
130328
	- fixed bug in Cell constructor
		- was causing problems with cell-to-cell drawImage operations
			- in every browser except firefox/IE9
	- revisited Example09
		- added scrawl.makeBezier(), scrawl.makeQuadratic()
			- to simplify the creation of these sprites
		- added scrawl.deleteSprite()
			- can take a string name, or an array of string names
	- revisited Example08
		- added scrawl.makeRegularShape()
			- can take the arguments 'sides', or 'angle'
		- updated Example10 to make use of the new function
	- tested in browsers
	- advanced to v0.0051a
	- updated website
	- updated sourceForge
	- started mapping out ideas on how to handle sprite sheets
		- new object - AnimSheet - to handle frame data
		- adapted Picture object to handle sprite sheets and the AnimSheet object
		- Scrawl.clone, Scrawl.checkValues updated
	- updated documentation
		
130327
	- worked on moving the startXY points of Shape objects
		- can't use handleXY for this - that's just a displacement factor
		- Shapes use polar coordinates focussed on sprite's startXY values
		- finalised Example16 - drawing lines on the canvas and rotating them
	- worked on cell translation and rotation
		- fixed Cell.translateCell and Cell.rotateCell
		- built Example17 to demonstrate cell transformations
			- TODO - font object not working as expected
	- added scrawl.makeLine - for the sake of sanity
		- line start or end points can be made static (fixed=true)
			- now a feature of Shape, but flag held in the Point object
	- updated the Wheel object
		- now includes flags for direction, and whether circle is open or closed
	- updated documentation
	
130326
	- researched the use of svg images on the canvas
		- revisited the idea of importing svg files into Scrawl as Shape objects
			- experimented with getting data from the svg file
			- abandoned the idea - too complex, and the results would (almost certainly) be poor
		- looked at using svg files embedded directly in the web page
			- managed to get this working, but only in Opera
				- resizing such images was very problematical
		- looked at using svg files imported via an <img> element on the web page
			- seems to work well in all browsers tested
			- results (in Picture objects) probably not as crisp as svg originals, eg when changing size
	- added Example15 - using svg image via the <img> tag
		- TODO - consider adding a scale attribute to all sprites
			- currently only Shape has this built in
			- a number of the examples (06, 10, 11, 15) resize their sprites as they run
			- would save the user having to code up scaling operations
	- updated documentation
			
130325
	- all user input checking centralised into Scrawl.checkValues() method
		- fixed Scrawl clone and set methods to use checkValues
			- no longer needs to change the names of cloned objects in the library and elsewhere
		- developed checks for colour input 
			- probably overkill, but a good exercise
			- can be removed later if impacts too much on animation speeds
		- simplified all Scrawl objects' constructors to use checkValues
			- setting of default values still handled by object constructors, not checkValues
	- finished changes to the Context object
		- now includes methods .getContextFromEngine(), .getChanges(), .swapStyles()
			- Sprite.swap() now makes use of Context.swapStyles()
		- Cell and Sprite objects now store the Context object name, not the context itself
			- fixed Cell constructor to get Context to generate/register a new instance for the Cell
			- fixed scrawl.getCanvas, scrawl.addNewCell, scrawl.deleteCells
			- fixed Pad constructor, Pad.addNewCell
			- Cell/Pad constructors no longer need flags, but do need a canvas element handle to act on it
		- Context objects referenced through the scrawl library - scrawl.ctx, scrawl.ctxnames
		- fixed Cell.setEngine
		- added/amended Sprite.clone and Sprite.set methods
		- fixed Sprite.stamp
	- updated Examples
		- stricter colour input testing now means 'red' is rejected - has to be 'Red', etc
	- tested Scrawl in various browsers - works for all Examples
	- moved version to 0.005a
	- updated documentation
		
130324
	- decided to rejig Scrawl's internal structure:
		- making Cell and Sprite contexts fully independent objects
			- new ctx object and ctxnames array in scrawl library
		- centralising all the paramater checking into one Scrawl method
		- mainly done as a learning experience ... and to make maintenance a little easier
			- will probably impact on animation speeds
				- currently doesn't work at all ...
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
130323
	- coded up scrawl.compile(), Pad.compile(), Cell.compile()
		- recoded Group to do sorting of sprites by their order parameter
		- recoded Pad to do sorting of groups by their order parameter
		- fixed scrawl.clone to ensure sprite renaming is registered with relevant groups
	- added Example13 - sprite reordering, adding user function to group, scrawl.render()
	- updated documentation
	- started considering drag-and-drop
		- not yet convinced it needs to be an intrinsic part of Scrawl
		- coded up Example14 
			- sprite selection handled by a user function added to the group
			- drag'n'drop handled by jQuery event listeners
	- updated website (v0.00441a)

130322
	- investigated the possibilities of importing SVG images into scrawl
		- it's a big job
		- worth investigating other js libraries that already have this function??
			- flag up as a possible coding exercise for sometime in the future ...
	- coded up getImageData function for the Cell object
		- will grab the whole Cell display, or just a part of it
		- takes parameters in an object: x, y, width, height, name, tables
			- tables argument can be a string of 'all', 'red', 'blue', 'green' or 'color'
			- or an array containing some of the above entries (except all, which gets ignored)
		- dumps the javascript imageData object into scrawl.imageData
		- optionally creates imageData tables (2 dimensional array) from the js imageData object
			_red, _green, _blue, _alpha - extracted data (0-255) for each of the rgba channels
			_color - table made up of rgba() values
		- access imageData tables - scrawl.imageDataTables[tableName][rowPosition][columnPosition]
			- where rowPosition === y coordinate
			- columnPosition === x coordinate
		- takes a long time to generate the tables: 1.5 - 2.5 secs for 750x375 image
		- returns the general name used for the tables
			- will generate specific tables with the names:
				generalName_red, generalName_blue, generalName_green, generalName_alpha, generalName_color
	- added Example12 - colour data under current mouse position
	- adapted getImageData function to work with Picture objects
		- captures the whole image
			- no arguments for capturing just part of it
			- only accepts a tables string or array
		- returns the Picture object
	- tested Example12a - getting imageData for Picture objects
	- updated documentation
	- upgraded library to v0.0044a
	- updated SourceForge page
	- updated website with latest version
	- updated github
			
130321
	- fixed Scrawl.set() and Scrawl.clone()
		- both now climb the hierarchy
		- objects that need to reset their own values after receiving new data ... do it
			- changes are triggered by object set() methods
			- changing data directly will often fail to be taken on board
				- myText.set({size: 30,}); will change the Phrase object's font size 
				- myText.size = 30; fails - object won't know to update its context.font value
		- got rid of the Util object
		- got rid of various flags - to simplify things for users
		- updated Pattern object to cope with new way of cloning things
	- tinkered with Shape and Phrase objects
		- Shape no longer needs arrays of its vectors and points, just the name of the initial point
		- Phrase now accepts metrics beyond 'px'
	- Shape objects no longer responsible for drawing their paths
		- instead, they just initiate the path drawing process
			- process works its way down the vector chain
		- Points are now responsible for checking their positions and reporting them back to vector objects
			- changing Point attributes must be done via set(), not directly
	- tested changes in various browsers
	- Point objects now require the name of their Shape in order to work
		- does mean that Shape objects should be set up before their associated Point and Vector objects
	- updated documentation
	- upgraded library to v0.0043a
	- updated SourceForge page
	- updated website with latest version
	- started github repository for key files
		
130320
	- developed the Phrase object for handling canvas text
		- font data can be entered either as separate items ...
				scrawl.newPhrase({
						text: "Hello!",
						weight: 'bold',
						style: 'italic',
						size: 40,
						family: 'Garamond, "Times New Roman", Georgia, serif',
						});		
		... or as a font string:
				scrawl.newPhrase({
						text: "Hello!",
						font: 'bold italic 40px Garamond, "Times New Roman", Georgia, serif',
						});		
		- added Example11 - animated text
		-checked performance in the usual browsers - appears okay (but not spectacular)
	- thought about text along path, Shape-like fonts (converted from SVG fonts), etc
		- something for later consideration
	- updated documentation
	- upgraded library to v0.0042a
	- updated SourceForge page
	- updated website with latest version

130319
	- recoded some of the Shape/Point/Vector code
	- added in scrawl methods to allow for a more shorthand method of creating point sets of point objects
		- scrawl.makeCartesianPoints()
		- scrawl.makePolarPoints()
	- tested Shape object further
		- see if a shape can hold more than one path (separated by moveTo() statements)
		- see if a shape can be created with holes in it 
			- yes, by following vector graphics conventions and doing the clockwise/anticlockwise thing
		- added Example10 - shapes with holes in them
	- updated documentation
	- started thinking about Text objects

130318
	- coded up Shapes object
		- shape's points defined by polar coordinates relative to the shape's startXY
		- point details held in separate Point objects
		- vector details held in separate Vector objects
			- Point() and Vector() inherit from Scrawl(), thus have .set() and .clone() methods
		- points and vectors are chained together
			- shape object asks vectors to draw themselves before performing stamp() operations
		- vectors coded: lineTo(); quadraticCurveTo(); bezierCurveTo()
		- Shape stamp routines: clear(); clip(); draw(); fill(); drawFill(); fillDraw(); emboss()
			- most of these not tested
			- non-draw operations limited to 'closed' shapes - can't fill an open shape
		- added Example08 - closed shape
		- added Example09 - open shape
	- checked to make sure shape objects work in other browsers - looks okay
	- updated documentation
	
130317
	- fixed Example07
		- used bigger image to help cells avoid the edge issue evident in the browser tests
		- used a globalCompositeOperation to build a stencil - a round magnifier in place of a square one
		- introduced Cell.handleX, Cell.handleY for copy ofsetting
	- coded some of the context formation events - scale, translate, rotate
		- NOT YET TESTED, just coded
		- decided against adding in transform()
			- Cell.transform() just calls up the scale, rotate and translate methods
	- added code to sprite objects to perform a clip()
		- initial testing - not good - clip performance vs globalCompositeOperation was dire
	- added in code to perform context save() and restore()
		- NOT YET TESTED, just coded
	- updated documentation
	- drafted spec for Scrawl Shapes object
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
130316
	- working on the issues surrounding multiple cells (beyond the default cells)
	- added routines to clean Scrawl library after each website example runs
	- replaced cloning system with one which works properly
	- implementing website examples
		- Example07 working
	- testing Example07 in browsers
		- all problems suggest more work needed on better use of canvas drawImage routines
		- Firefox - works (mostly) as desired - magnifier image distorts on bottom/right borders of display cell
		- Internet Explorer - works, but magnifier border out by one pixel
		- Safari - works to a point - magnifier stops working when going beyond right/bottom borders of display cell
		- Opera - works in same manner as Firefox
		- Chrome - works (mostly) as expected
			- magnifier leaves red border at top of display when moving back onto the canvas from the top
			- magnifier image (but not border) disappears when it touches the bottom/right edges of the display cell
	- started complete rewrite of documentation
	- uploaded v0.004 to SourceForge
	- updated website to v0.004

130315
	- continued working on groups
	- implementing website examples
		- Example04 working
	- tested Scrawl in various browsers; fixed (where possible) bugs exposed by the exercise
		- Firefox 19.0.2 (windows 7)
		- Internet Explorer 9.0.8112.16421  (windows 7)
		- Safari 5.1.7 (windows 7)
		- Opera 12.14 (windows 7)
		- Chrome 25.0.1364.172 m (windows 7) ... Scrawl looks best on Chrome
	- further work on animation
	- implementing website examples
		- Example06 working
		
130314
	- fixed patterns object
	- implementing website examples
		- Example02 working
		- Example03 working
		- Example05 working
	- started working on Scrawl groups

130313
	- ported reusable code from v0.0031 to v0.004
	- worked on a cloning system for Scrawl objects
	- started work on implementing website examples
		- Example01 - working

130312
	- encapsulated library
	- coded up bones of the various classes
	- worked on object inheritance

130311
	- sketched out schematic of new version

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
130310
	- v0.0031(alpha) abandoned - code was becoming too complex

130309
	- updated documentation
	- fixed Scrawl.displayWipedPads() glitch
		- coded Scrawl.wipeDisplayPads(), Scrawl.wipeCurrentPads(), Cell.wipeDisplay(), Cell.wipeCurrent()
	- code for adding (new) cells to a pad
		- coded Cell.set(), Cell.clone()
		- coded Pad.add()
		- coded Scrawl.addCell(), Scrawl.newCell()
		- added Cell.user{} attribute
		- tested for all six possible Pad.add() arguments
			- ('existingCellName') 
				- returns the named cell object
			- ('newCellName') 
				- returns NEW cell with name = 'newCellName'
			- (existingCellObject)
				- returns the named cell object
			- (objectWithNameAttributeWhichIsNotAnExistingCellName)
				- returns NEW cell with name = objectWithNameAttributeWhichIsNotAnExistingCellName.name
			- (objectWith-NO-NameAttribute)
				- returns NEW cell with name along the lines of currentCellName_xxxxxx
				- returns NEW cell with name based around CELL_xxxxxx
			- new cells take on board any attribute changes the user may have included in the object
				- existing cells ignore any such changes
		- coded Cell.resetToContext() - in case browsers differ from the Scrawl Cell/Sprite context defaults
			- added this in to Scrawl.getCanvas() to ensure consistency from the start
		- moved as much cell construction and registration stuff as possible into the Cell object
			- major reconstruction to Scrawl.getCanvas()
		- added Pad.addCells (different to Pad.add() - this one is private)
	- added Group.user{}; coded Group.clone() - for consistency & completeness
	- added Pad.user{}; coded Pad.set(), Pad.clone() - for consistency & completeness
	- implemented sprite.visibility and group.visibility directives in Cell.compileSprite() and Group.render()
	- updated documentation
	
130308
	- finished coding the wheel object
	- experimented with adding jQuery event listeners to control animations
		- fixed: Scrawl.getCanvas() was renaming original 'canvas' to 'canvas_display'
			- needed to be changed, as not obvious to casual users setting up jQuery listeners!
		- removed Block.animation, Block.lineCap attributes
	- move sprite rendering code into sprite.prototype - to keep things easier
		- sprite.method changed from ARRAY[STRING] to STRING - to simplify stuff
		- all the sprite-related switch material in Cell.compileSprite moved to the sprite.prototype objects
		- added Block.stamp(), Wheel.stamp() to handle the work
		- added doShadow attribute to Block and Wheel
			- handles fillDraw and drawFill glitch where the shadow was being drawn twice
	- added Block.clear(), Wheel.clear()
		- added doFill attribute to Block and Wheel
			- triggers a Cell.fillStyle change to transparent without changing the sprite's innate fillStyle property
	- added Scrawl.flag{} object 
		- was an abandoned attempt to fix the shadow problem, but may come in useful later
			- any context attribute can now be forced by setting the appropriate Scrawl.flag to true
				- does mirror the PadCommand force array - two systems to do the same job may be overkill
	- added Scrawl.radian constant - eases calculation of arcs and stuff
	- added Block.user{} and Wheel.user{} attributes
		- a place where users can add in their own variables, which can then be cloned to new objects
			- example004 now makes use of this feature
				- previously just added user variables to the Sprite object - couldn't be cloned
	- coded Cell methods fn_beginPath(), fn_arc(), fn_closePath(), fn_fill(), fn_stroke()
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
130307
	- finished coding Group.render()
		- added Group.cleanup() to clean up the mess made by Group.render() and Group.renderSpriteUp()
		- TODO: probably better to prevent virtual Sprite/Group object registering with Scrawl
			- no need to cleanup if no mess made in the first place
	- developed the demonstration/testing website - currently on localhost
	- started working on animation
		- currently have user code animation functions outside of Scrawl
		- added Scrawl.setCellDimensions(), Cell.setDimensions()
			- for resizing Cells and setting their sX/sY/sW/sH/dX/dY/dW/dH attributes
		- added Scrawl.displayWipedPads(), Pad.wipeShow()
			- to assist user with Cell animation
		- added requestAnimFrame (shim by Paul Irish - http://paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/
		- TODO: displaying an example after an animation - sprites sometimes lose their borders!
	- updated documentation
	- version 0.003(a) - to celebrate getting things moving on the screen!
	- started building a Wheel (circle) sprite object
	
130306
	- fixed CellCommand object; changed its name to PadCommand
		- fixed Block.draw/fill/drawFill/fillDraw() to work with PadCommand
		- removed Block.checkRender()- no longer needed
	- moved Cell.renderSpriteUp() to Group.renderSpriteUp() - to cleanup the purpose of Cell
		- fixed Block.draw/fill/drawFill/fillDraw() to work with Group.renderSpriteUp()
		- changed Pad.renderSpriteUp() to Pad.render()
		- fixed Group.renderSpriteUp(); fixed Pad.renderSpriteUp()
	- fixed Scrawl.displayPad() so it delegates the work to Pad objects; changed method name to displayPads()
		- changed Pad.display() to Pad.show(); method coded
	- added Scrawl.clearPads(); method coded
	- added Pad.clear(); method coded
